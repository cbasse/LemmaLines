Therefore, people literally couldn\u2019t see him.\n\n2) Since it\u2019s \u201chis house,\u201d he\u2019s claiming to be better than other rappers. Rappers compare their status in the rap game to houses often.\n\nThis is also a play on how Ma$e would always wear hats that were so low on his head they would cover his eyebrows.\n\n\n\nEminem would reuse these lines in the 1999 posse-cut The Anthem. Jerry Springer is notorious for bringing out crazy people and letting them duke it out on camera (Although much of it is staged), The people on the show rush from offstage yelling violently.

This is a very modest statement since humidity can only increase the perceived temperature by around five degrees:\n\n Humans are very sensitive to humidity, as the skin relies on the air to get rid of moisture. The process of sweating is your body\u2019s attempt to keep cool and maintain its current temperature. If the air is at 100-percent relative humidity, sweat will not evaporate into the air. As a result, we feel much hotter than the actual temperature when the relative humidity is high. If the relative humidity is low, we can feel much cooler than the actual temperature because our sweat evaporates easily, cooling \u00adus off. For example, if the air temperature is 75 degrees Fahrenheit (24 degrees Celsius) and the relative humidity is zero percent, the air temperature feels like 69 degrees Fahrenheit (21 C) to our bodies. If the air temperature is 75 degrees Fahrenheit (24 C) and the relative humidity is 100 percent, we feel like it\u2019s 80 degrees (27 C) out. The moment immediately after Mel-Man shit on the world was captured as the album cover for the album this song originally appeared on, Dr. Dre Presents: The Aftermath The historically black fraternity is noted for the quality of its step teams, and they use the barking sound.\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ7XJbT0ock The sporting goods company Reebok started an ad campaign with the tag line, \u201cThis is my planet\u201d, shortly before this song was released.\n\n\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_ZyPcMmiwQ In this case, a firearm. A dish of shrimp sauteed in butter, scampi is considered something of a delicacy and would be difficult to afford on the budget enforced by the minimal value of food stamps. Attempting to afford it would require purchasing incredients, especially the shrimp themselves, of questionable quality. The Dallas Cowboys won Super Bowl XXX thanks largely to their cornerback Larry Brown intercepting two passes by Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Neil O'Donnell in the second half. Though he now sports a shaved head, the famed Cowboys running back had a somewhat lengthy forehead. This line is an interpolation of an infamous line by Audio Two and basically means that Dr. Dre & D-Ruff are chilling and making money As at the beginning of the verse, Mel goes for the larger-than-life cosmic imagery. Mel-Man ain\u2019t givin' no chronic to no-one, beotch!\n\nEspecially not his last \u201cdub\u201d \u2013 double dime\u2019s worth of weed. It would seem that Mel-Man still hasn\u2019t been able to shake off the bruising effects of child poverty. Well, either that, or he\u2019s a scoundrel cheating fellow citizens out of their tax dollars\u2026 Mel-Man: a true rags-to-riches American hero. Hang on, Mellie! You said in the verse before that you\u2019re allergic to skins\u2026 Oh, hang on, of course: that\u2019s why you need to get back to the clap clinic! \u201cHatorrade: the beverage for people who unjustly refuse to recognise Mel-Man\u2019s brilliance \u2013 and all them other bitch-ass niggaz on the dick.\u201d\n\nOr something like that. Neat little word-game with the hononymic \u201creign\u201d and \u201crain\u201d combo, here. Mel-Man has run out of worldly images to describe his greatness, and so is going cosmic with his imagery (although I suppose the idea of him being great enough to be able to shit on the world counts as cosmic, too, because he\u2019d actually have to be bigger than the planet\u2026) It would appear that Mel-Man has a penchant for group sex mixed with an allergy to condoms \u2013 bad combination in terms of venereal health. Lovely internal and over-line rhyming scheme here with \u201c-anger\u201d. Okay, Mel-Man, we get it: you don\u2019t give a fuck about anyone or anything else except you. 1996: until the release of the Playstation, the Sega Megadrive and the Nintendo64 have been dividing up the games market between them. This was the year in which the Sega Saturn bombed, so all eyes were on Sony\u2019s Playstation. You can either shag or beat Mel-Man senseless \u2013 he really is chilled! A big part of Dre\u2019s 1996 Aftermath album on which this appeared was a reconciliation between the feuding East and West Coasts. Ah, that classic early-to-mid nineties Snoop Dogg-style \u201c-zzy\u201d on the end of everything.

S\u00fbrement une r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 Bertrand Cantat comme dans 11 Septembre pour montrer que ce n'est pas uniquement chez les \u201carabes\u201d que la violence conjugale est pr\u00e9sente. (cf. Affaire Eric Raoult ) Un double rejet de pr\u00e9jug\u00e9s selon lesquels tous les hommes pensent avec leur entre-jambe et que les plus dangereux sont parqu\u00e9s en banlieue. M\u00e9dine sait manier les mots, il le d\u00e9montre encore ici en rappelant le titre du morceau. Mais cette fois le M\u00e2le devient mal\u00e9fique quand la femme repr\u00e9sente le Bien qui guide notre monde.\nL'\u00e9vocation nouvelle du mot \u201cf\u00e9lin\u201d r\u00e9introduit le fait que les femmes sont vitales \u00e0 la survie de l'homme. Jeu de mots astucieux qui m\u00e9lange la fonction r\u00e9publicaine de Maire et celle, plus naturelle, de m\u00e8re.\nIl avoue son impuissance de m\u00e2le par rapport \u00e0 la gestion instinctive qu'ont les femmes pour \u00e9lever leur prog\u00e9niture. Le succ\u00e8s d'un homme est facilit\u00e9 par la volont\u00e9 de sa femme \u00e0 le soutenir dans ses actions. Ainsi le m\u00e9rite n'est pas l'unique bien du leader. Encore une fois il modifie l'expression Derri\u00e8re chaque grand homme il y a une femme en l'appliquant aux c\u00e9l\u00e8bres personnages de Disney Voil\u00e0 ce que regrette M\u00e9dine sur le fonctionnement de notre soci\u00e9t\u00e9 et sa mise en valeur de la femme Parall\u00e9lisme avec la premi\u00e8re ligne du morceau.\n- J'ai mis des couplets sur ma plaie ouverte (11 syllabes)\n- J'ai mis des mesures sur ma large blessure (11 syllabes) Et oui, \u00e7a vous la coupe hein !\nLe roi de la jungle confie son besoin le plus essentiel \u00e0 sa compagne. Les femmes se respecteraient bien plus que les hommes ne le font envers elles. M\u00e9dine est d\u00e9\u00e7u par tous les pr\u00e9jug\u00e9s qui nourrissent la guerre des Sexes.\nCar, o\u00f9 il a grandit ce sont souvent les femmes qui \u00e9l\u00e8vent les enfants quand le p\u00e8re a abandonn\u00e9 la famille. En grammaire une r\u00e8gle d'accord veut que le masculin l'emporte lorsque ce genre est pr\u00e9sent au moins une fois dans la phrase, m\u00eame si il est noy\u00e9 au milieu de plusieurs mots f\u00e9minins.\nLa langue fran\u00e7aise serait-elle machiste ? Ce n'est pas le r\u00eave d'un misogyne d'avoir un enfant du \u201csexe faible\u201d. Pr\u00e9jug\u00e9 dominant chez la gente f\u00e9minine qui est persuad\u00e9e que les hommes ne pensent pas avec la t\u00eate. Il ajuste le proverbe Derri\u00e8re chaque grand homme il y a une femme. Au bout de seize ans de mariage. Apr\u00e8s l'argument litt\u00e9raire vient l'argument scientifique (avec des lettres quand-m\u00eame hein\u2026). On notera que come au premier couplet l'Arabian Panther compare l'homme au f\u00e9lin. Rita Marley est la veuve de Bob Marley. La chanteuse Koxie a sorti en 2007 le single Gar\u00e7on o\u00f9 une jeune femme est en butte \u00e0 la vulgarit\u00e9 et au sexisme d'un groupe de gar\u00e7ons pas tr\u00e8s fins. Dans le refrain, on entend \u00ab Gar\u00e7on, si t'enl\u00e8ves la c\u00e9dille, \u00e7a fait Garcon et gare aux cons ma fille \u00bb.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ythzoQih-XU&ob=av2n M\u00e9dine adapte la citation (anonyme) qui dit\n\nQuand le sage montre la lune, le sot regarde le doigt\n\nhttp://youtu.be/sDW6vkuqGLg?t=1m10s\n\nA lier \u00e0 la mesure pr\u00e9c\u00e8dente, comme il le dit dans \u201cAn\u00e9anti\u201d:\n\u201cCe que je suis est tellement fort, qu'ils en oublient mon discours\u201d Le magazine Elle est un hebdomadaire fran\u00e7ais destin\u00e9 \u00e0 un public f\u00e9minin. Ses d\u00e9tracteurs lui reprochent de se donner une image f\u00e9ministe qui ne correspond pas (ou plus) \u00e0 la r\u00e9alit\u00e9. Ni putes ni soumises est un mouvement f\u00e9ministe fran\u00e7ais fond\u00e9 en 2003. L'association se donne pour objectif de lutter contre les violences faites aux femmes et fait la promotion de la la\u00efcit\u00e9 et de l'\u00e9galit\u00e9 entre les sexes. Ses opposants lui ont reproch\u00e9 de victimiser les femmes \u00e0 outrance et de participer \u00e0 la stigmatisation des banlieues (Afrik). M\u00e9dine fait allusion \u00e0 l'homme politique d'Afrique du Sud Nelson Mandela et \u00e0 sa seconde \u00e9pouse Winnie Madikizela, ainsi qu'au couple que formaient Malcolm X et sa femme Betty Shabazz.\nSi leurs \u00e9poux sont plus connus qu'elles, ces deux femmes \u00e9taient \u00e9galement engag\u00e9es politiquement. Winnie Mandela est rapidement devenue une ic\u00f4ne de la lutte contre l'apartheid (\u00e9voluant m\u00eame vers un discours \u2013 beaucoup \u2013 plus radical que celui de son mari), et Betty Shazzab a soutenu les activit\u00e9s de son \u00e9poux.\n\n\n\n(Nelson et Winnie Mandela) Simone Signoret (1921-1985) et Yves Montand (1921-1991) \u00e9taient deux acteurs fran\u00e7ais. Ils se mari\u00e8rent en 1951 et rest\u00e8rent ensemble jusqu'\u00e0 la mort de Simone Signoret, malgr\u00e9 les infid\u00e9lit\u00e9s d'Yves Montand.

Big Boi\u2019s saying this woman\u2019s complexity was stunning (hence the \u201cparalyzing\u201d). What started as a good time soon took a turn for the worse, as 3 party-goers got stabbed and hauled off in an ambulance during a disagreement. Since Andr\u00e9 claims that this club is located in \u201cNiggaville, USA\u201d, he is implying that this sort of thing happens in many urban night clubs like this one. Like Andr\u00e9, Big Boi simply speaks his mind on this verse without actually rapping. Andr\u00e9 reveals the rationale behind that in this interview:\n\nIceberg Slim used to put out albums talking on beats and I was like, \u201cThis is cool.\u201d I think I laid down my verse first and Big just came in. But instead of spoken word, Big likes to call it \u201csmokin' word.\u201d That was his smokin' word.\" While 3 A.M. sounds pretty late to most of us, it really wasn\u2019t that late for the Atlanta club scene around this time. Sleepy reveals in his verse that most clubs don\u2019t close til 4 AM. Andre is leaving margin for error because, as you recall, he was gone off the Olde E. and his version may have some inaccuracies. He confirms this in an interview:\n\nI was so drunk I didn\u2019t make into Charles. So all the stuff I said after that was made up.\" The \u201cfolks\u201d in this case are the police. Meeting this fine girl was an event that marked his memory in such a way that he will remember it forever. In the words of Big Boi:\n\nSpottieOttieDopalicious is Southern slang term for a girl that is superfine, bad, sexy, intelligent and jazzy all at the same time. I got one of those upstairs in my bed. This girls eyes were so brilliant and shiny that Big Boi compares them to a 4-karat diamond. Because of this, he can\u2019t even look her in the eye, out of both nervousness and astonishment. Sleepy and his boys are a group of young men with a lot of money and their whole lives in front of them. So they can stay out and party until they feel like stopping. In other words:\n\nIt\u2019s on til the break of dawn, and we\u2019re starting  this party from dusk\" Sleepy is riding around the city in his Dickie shorts and his Lincoln, a blunt lit, checking out what is going on in ATL this fine evening. Charles' was most likely an 18+ club, so it served as a stepping stone for young adults in Atlanta before they really discovered the party scene. Turning what was originally supposed to be a one night stand into a long term relationship that resulted in the birth of a beautiful baby girl can be a beautiful thing \u2013 as long as you are mature enough to stick around and raise the daughter instead of bolting on the family. People who have \u201cnappy\u201d hair that want to straighten it without getting a perm often use a hot comb. Big Boi compares the smooth way this girl acts to the smooth motions of the comb through his hair. Once the liquor is in your system, the \u201clukeworm lullabies\u201d blend perfectly with \u201cSet It Off\u201d instead of clashing. The chaotic and sporadic environment around Andr\u00e9 becomes much more harmonious once he begins drinking. Candied yams are a sweet soul food dish very popular in the South. The woman mentioned in previous lines is both southern (like yams) and sweet smelling. The \u201cextra syrup\u201d adds to the gluttony of her image. A syrup naturally forms when sweet yams are prepared; therefore, extra syrup is always a pleasurable bonus. This particular woman is thick like a brown stallion, but moves smoothly and elegantly across the floor like an ice skater. A reference to an episode of the show \u201cGood Times\u201d. The head of the household, James, dies in an accident and his wife, Florida, loses her composure after the funeral when she realizes that he is truly gone. \u201cDamn, damn, damn!\u201d is the resulting quote. The scene has been cited as one of the realest moments in the series. This is reflected in the song, which speaks on real-life stories.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKUwcCp7LPE In what I\u2019m sure was a relief to his baby mama, Big Boi finally reveals that this \u201cSpottieOttieDopaliscious\u201d female isn\u2019t just a random lady he met at the bar; she is the woman he had his daughter Jordan with. Big Boi is amazed at how a casual encounter at a nightclub eventually led to one of the most important events in his life: the birth of his baby daughter. The DJ of this club essentially serves the same role as a piano man at a bar; they are both expected to play good music non-stop, forcing the patrons to begin to dance and forget all their worries as they work up a sweat. Andr\u00e9 reveals in an interview that this verse was inspired by an actual event where he got so drunk he couldn\u2019t make it into the club:\n\nMe and Big Boi were in high school when we started going and getting drunk. This is how the night happened for real: I was so drunk I didn\u2019t make into Charles. So all the stuff I said after that was made up. But I remember saying to Big Boi, I\u2019m so drunk I cannot leave this van. That\u2019s the real story. When you need a regular fixed income to support a family, drug dealing just won\u2019t cut it. The drug market is too volatile \u2013 and if you are incarcerated or murdered, then your family is bereft of a breadwinner Andre simply, but very beautifully interprets the Atlanta nightclub scene in this verse \u2013 a wonderful place where people try to forget the problems of the world, despite the fact that these problems are often reflected in the club itself. Evander Holyfield is a former undisputed heavyweight champion of the world. And seeing as he was a proud ATLien, saying the atmosphere at this party was similar to that after a Holyfield victory means things were pretty hoppin'. \u201cChiefed\u201d is slang for smoked. Just one look at this girl is enough to make Big Boi feel as disoriented as he would if he smoked an ounce of high grade Presidential marijuana. Although selling drugs from the \u201ctrap\u201d might be glorified in mainstream media, think (\u201cmarinate\u201d) on the notion that it\u2019s actually a trap \u2013 once you\u2019re involved in the drug game, it\u2019s very hard to get out and turn over a new leaf. Big Boi begins to speak on the vicious cycle that most D-boys that want to get out of the game have to go through. They try to quit dealing drugs and get themselves a real job at places like the Post Office, but most places like that drug test their applicants. And when these former drug dealers inevitably fail these drug tests, they end up having to get back in the game again to support themselves and their family. Andr\u00e9 describes the dichotomy that exists in a young man surrounded by alluring women and other brash young men at a party. On one hand, he wants to succumb to the \u201clullabies\u201d this fine young girl is whispering into his ear and slip out the back door with her. But on the other, he wants to get into the fray with his peers and \u201cset it off\u201d, throwing elbows and acting unruly.\n\nThis could also be a reference to the song \u201cSet it Off\u201d by Strafe, whose hook says \u201cset it off on the left y'all, set it off on the right\u201d:\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYkKF7-xofE This line plays off of the last line about Charles Dickens to mention the Charles Disco, a popular night club in East Atlanta when the duo was coming up (\u201cdiscotheque\u201d is another word for nightclub).\n\nAndr\u00e9 is directly referencing this particular disco, but by saying it is located in the generic town of \u201cNiggaville, USA\u201d, he is implying that there are tons of other nightclubs similar to Charles\u2019s in urban areas across the country where similar things go down. \u201cAs all outdoors\u201d is a term used to exaggerate the enormity of a situation/action. So Andr\u00e9 is just letting the listener know how fine this girl really was. \u201cAs the plot thickens\u201d is a phrase that means as things become more complex or interesting. And when something \u201cgives you the dickens\u201d it causes you to become angry or upset. So as this verse goes on, Andr\u00e9 is going to get more and more upset with the ATL nightlife scene that he observes.\n\nThis line also shouts out one of the most well-known English authors of all time, Charles Dickens. Hollywood Courts was a low-rise housing project in Northwest Atlanta until it was demolished in 2009. Apparently there are some party-goers that are acting ignorant and professing their allegiance to this neighborhood.\n\n\n\nJ. Cole creatively re-interpreted this line in \u201cWho Dat\u201d as:\n\nWho else really tryna fuck with Hollywood Cole?\n\nDrake recycled this line as well in \u201cRight Above It\u201d.

In the Sailing the Seas of Cheese version Tom Waits provides the voice of Tommy the Cat. For emphasis ;) Another reference to Tommy\u2019s ultimate masculinity.  This could also be an allusion to He-Man, who was quite popular around the release of this song. A stud bull is one raised for the purpose of mating and producing strong offspring. These are prize animals, as they would be used to impregnate a large number of females at once.\n\nThe female here is looking for the stud bull, the biggest and baddest of them all, the only one worthy of breeding with. This was a female the likes of which had never been seen in this alley. A double take refers to the shock when someone looks in passing, then snaps back to look at it again in disbelief.  A triple take would be even more shocking and exaggerated, a usually intentional third glance, to show everyone around that you are looking at something unbelievable. Tommy had lived a life of adventure and intrigue, but often let others tell the tales of his life.  On this special occasion, he took the liberty to tell his own story. The title \u201curban predator\u201d is appropriate for Tommy, as he spends his life in the streets, hunting vermin to stay alive. To clear your throat indicates that you are about to tell a long story, which Tommy certainly is.  This excessively descriptive language sets the stage for the entire song, which is a tall tale of the most epic of cats. This is likely a reference to Thomas O'Malley from The Aristocats; a famous animated alleycat. Tommy the Cat is his name, a play on tomcat is his game. A tomcat is slang for a male who gets it in, and gets it in often. Multiple other plays on this are throughout the song, such as \u201che-cat\u201d (a tomcat), and \u201cstud bull\u201d. Tommy the Cat is the Peter North of the urban alleyway known as O'malley\u2019s Alley. This vivacious female is well aware, and why she passes by these beta-male fuckbois and goes straight to Tommy. She knew what she wanted. She sought it out. And Tommy is ready to satisfy her feline cravings. Many rats have been killed by Tommy immediately after staring down his throat. It is like this just happened to him. In other words, this is basically a food-oriented version of the phrase, \u201cI remember it as if it was yesterday\u201d, referring to how it sticks out so much in his mind that it feels like a very recent part of his routine. A play on words based on the focus on a cat character in the song, and the presence of \u201ccatcalls\u201d, a slang term for a loud public expression of disapproval. A cartoonish and quirky type of description usually found in Les Claypool lyrics. A drove is groups of animals moving together such as a herd or a flock.

Back in the days when they were on the streets of New York, one man would pull a gun on you while the other eight would be watching you carefully, ready to spring.

Some guy Drake got in a beef with earlier in his career in Canada. He pretty much demolished his career with song and a final track he did with some of his earlier rapper buddies called \u201cGood Riddance.\u201d\n\nApparently Aristo thought Drake was throwin subliminal\u2019s at him and got all butt hurt and decided to start dissin him. Drake being the up and coming emcee he was at the time couldn\u2019t back down and put this out. There isn\u2019t very many girls that he will actually fall in love with and \u201ckiss on\u201d affectionately.  With all the other girls he just turns on the charm & gets what he wants from them and leaves it at that.  No feelings. Drake is 6'0,but it\u2019s rap we can exaggerate let him disappear from the game  He does not see the reason why people diss him and mention his name Drake is on top of these rappers while he may look down on them he will still help them out to make it big An entry exam is required to receive a student loan. Drake is saying that Aristo\u2019s so called drug money is a front. The guys dissing Drake say there gonna come at him but they always end up backing down. Like he says in Club Paradise \u201cThey say its on when they see me, that day don\u2019t ever come.\u201d I think the line is actually \u201cYou get one flow and you do fo'\u201d Which is to say either the ones dissing him only get one song to do so; or you put out one song and people start to take shots. Matter of fact, dawg, here\u2019s a pencil\nGo home, write some shit, make it suspenseful\nAnd don\u2019t come back until somethin' dope hits you\nFuck it, you can take the mic home with you\n\nDrake is telling Aristo to enjoy his stay on the island and create something decent doing the time spent there. Obviously, Aristo\u2019s lines need some work\u2026 Drake dosen\u2019t care if you call him a name, it\u2019s not hurting him. Also saying your the only one benefitting from calling me a name. Drake is saying bust them shots (guns) and pretend your a gangster. Some rappers aren\u2019t real gangsters it\u2019s just a fake persona that record labels make you act as. To him your nothing bigger than a thumb tack. He is wearing a Rolex watch(Rolex is a swiss made watch) that has white and yellow gold. Reference to eggs that are over easy (yellow and white). Jody Breeze is a member of Hip-Hop group Boyz in the Hood. This plays off with the Young Jeezy line because he used to be in the group. And apparently Drake has done a couple tracks with him and Jody has heard Aristo\u2019s songs and thinks his flow is sounds like Jeezy\u2019s. So Aristo is biting Jeezy\u2019s flow. CTE is Young Jeezy\u2019s label.\n\nDrake is stating that Aristo is dickriding or copying Young Jeezy. CTV (Canadian Television) a Canadian network that I\u2019m assuming Drake has been on frequently if not that network, he is Canadian and was on another Candian Network with Degrassi so it still fits even if he hasn\u2019t frequented that network. He starts with a continuation of the last line. \u201cAsk Juicy if I stay fly\u2026 on the cellphone.\u201d \u201cgot a ten on the other end like an eight by\u201d is him saying he\u2019s so fly he\u2019s got a dime piece on the phone. 8x10 feet is the commonly accepted typical measurement of a jail cell. It\u2019s a play on words, as in cell phone and jail cell. \u201cNever sold a Century Sam\u201d which people use to put weed in. So if they haven\u2019t even sold and empty blunt they are obviously shit hustlers.\n\n\n\nAlso, a century is 100 years, Drake means that these fakers haven\u2019t sold $100 worth of coke, let alone papers for weed\u2026 Arista has nothing going for him; Wack mixtapes and singles that never caught on, and bc of this, Drake concludes that Arista is going after him because he wants fame The future seems bright for Drake, the other (Arista) has his career coming to an end after this track Drake references LL Cool J\u2019s 16\" record \u201cMama Said Knock You Out\u201d, which starts off with the famous line \u201cdon\u2019t call it a comeback\u201d.\n\nIn LL\u2019s case, he didn\u2019t want his record to be called a comeback because he felt like he had never fallen off. But Drake is saying that Aristo can\u2019t call his diss track a comeback because it did nothing to help his already unremarkable career. beautiful metaphor, \u201ctiring\u201d like tires = the michelin crew, a tires company.\nMichelin man Drake needed to make a statement because some canadian rappers didnt take his music serious being that he was \u201cjimmy\u201d from Degrassi. Drake is instructing Aristo to go ahead and dig his own grave, because Drake doesn\u2019t feel like doing so is even worth his time. Juicy J made a song with Three Six Mafia named \u201cStay Fly\u201d\n\nso if Juicy J says that Drake is fly then he must be fly. He\u2019s advanced, while yall are still basic Drake isn\u2019t really stressing the fact he got dissed, he\u2019s just chilling in his car, rolling a blunt, and getting ready to end Aristo\u2019s career.

Legendary NBA player Wilt Chamberlain has claimed to have slept with over 20,000 women in his life time. he talks alot of shit ( in a good way) A setup for the next two lines: Wayne is saying he\u2019s a young rebel, which sounds like \u201ca young Rubble\u201d, as in Barney (or in this case Bamm-Bamm) Rubble from The Flintstones. He needs a young female in his life.\n\nWayne is referencing the previous line where he says he\u2019s a young Rubble (with a babyface). And if he\u2019s a young Rubble, he\u2019d need a young Pebbles (the daughter of Fred Flintstone). Wayne stunts so hard (and so often) that he could use a stunt double Well, this song was out before Drake got big\u2026 A play on words. Whenever a song is played on the radio or club, they call it a spin; Drake\u2019s music is played so much, they\u2019re getting dizzy. Despite Wayne\u2019s questionable decisions on the mic as of late, he still gives us a good line here and there. And it just so happens this one\u2019s alongside fellow Young Money member Drake and Kid-Kidd (aka Nut Da Kid). He compares his crew to the legendary wrestling faction, The Four Horsemen, which consisted of the 16-time World Champion Ric Flair, Barry Windham, and Ole Anderson during their 1990 \u2013 1991 run in the south\u2019s World Championship Wrestling. Not bad company to compare yourself to. Now all they need is a Sid Vicious, who was added to the actual Four Horsemen to fill the final spot in the group.\n\nGudda Gudda, maybe? Weezy is a:\n\n\n\nYou\u2019re just a:\n\n\n\nResult of fuckin wit wayne? Two fingers is a common gesture for \u201cpeace\u201d, which Weezy gives once he leaves the scene of the crime. When you put all of us together just know that its going down Dominique Dawes was an Olympic gold medalist acrobat and Wayne uses a play on \u201cstick a landing\u201d to signify having sex Acrobats and stuntdevils both perfom ridiculous stunts David Hasselhoff was the star of Baywatch in which he was the head lifeguard over a team of beach babes like Pamela Anderson Wayne is comparing himself to a quarterback who stays in the pocket who while let his money go as if he is throwing a pass. Hulk Hogan was a member of nWo which consisted of Scott Hall and Kevin Nash and formed in 1996. Wayne is drinking lean which is a mix of possibly Sprite or Hawaiian Punch and codeine Drake turned his ordinary life into a superstar life, reppin his city toronto,  and starting the rap game there, now hes at vmas, being the apprentice of millionaire weezy, so if u ask me, he\u2019s a BOSS Chris Paul had a nice floater. After Drake effortlessly makes wins, it\u2019s game over for the competition. He\u2019s balling like Chris Paul. Sitting on at least 22\u2019s if he sitting tall. While he\u2019s drunk from sipping on those thousand dollar bottles he\u2019s in a good mood and takes photos with everyone. If they turn out to be a hatter, he takes them out of the picture or he crops them and focuses only on himself. Following up on his last line, he just wants to have fun. So he does it popping expensive bottles. Drake niggas are disgusted by just hearing the word \u201cplea\u201d. They\u2019d much rather go to jail than to be a snitch. Drake chose all real niggas to be in his team. She knows she better say he the man or she\u2019ll be hanging over the banister like Vanilla Ice. He\u2019s balling touring around the country. And even though he traveling cheap on a bus he stunting on that bitch.\n\nRTA stands for Regional Transportation Authority. The standard fare for a one-way trip on a bus or streetcar is $1.25. Reference to Suge Knight hanging Vanilla Ice upside down from a hotel balcony. Explaining further how the feds will never get him. To go ghost is to disappear. The feds can\u2019t catch him \u2018cus he\u2019ll stop talking to people that\u2019s hot and making phone calls for a while.\n\nI think he\u2019s talking about the ghost in Pacman, Pacman isn\u2019t a ghost. Another basketball reference, this time to the San Antonio Spurs. Also means when the feds try to get him, he\u2019s a spur. He\u2019s elusive like a backwards password. Example: red rum, if you hear someone say red rum you might not know what they are talking about, but it could be gangsters talking about murder since redrum backwards is murder. He wears expensive Mink fur, which makes him look like a black grizzly bear. If you want to see more of his balling he needs to be fed \u2013 paid. He needs meat to survive.\n\nAlso A reference to Seymour Krelborn\u2019s Little Shop of Horror and probably to Audrey Junior from Little Shop that had a huge appetite for meat. He stays on the grind. Thinking so far ahead that he doesn\u2019t even see the past or present, just what will come. While most niggas thinking about the past, Kid Kid only concerned about the future and new accomplishments. Living in the Carter is most likely a reference to Lil Wayne\u2019s first Carter album when Wayne was still hustling and hadn\u2019t blown up to the height he is now. ANOTHER play on words. he follows up with the basketball and the stunting reference in the last line. The way he says \u201cdunk\u201d sounds like donk \u2013 a pimped out car. Another play on words. Ball: 1) To play basketball. 2) To stunt.\n\nHe balls so much harder than anyone on his team that passing would be pointless. A play on the word stunt. Stunt: 1) an unusual and difficult physical feat 2) showing off.\n\nJackie Chan does his own stunts \u2013 hard stunts that most people can\u2019t do and have to get stunt doubles to do it for them.\n\nKid-Kid stunts so much in New Orleans that he\u2019s Jackie Chan. YOu know he stunts cause he writes Birdman AkA Stunner rhymes because a bar is a rhyme He means people told him pick one thing and work hard at that one thing but he didnt. He does multiply things singing, rapping and acting. So therefore he isnt in one lane he swerves As in Seymour Krelborn from Little Shop of Horrors He means \u201cbang\u201d as in gang bangin' because Wayne is a Blood hes a douchebag sometimes the flows overwhelming them and they\u2019re drowning. A setup between the young rebel/young Rubble line because Bamm-Bamm Rubble (a young Rubble) has a baby face.\n\nBirdman\u2019s name also used to be baby. Birdman is considered to be \u201cWeezy\u2019s dad\u201d, which is why he says he has a baby face. you cant be compared to weezy cause he is not even on a level you can compare with! That weed smells like shit Being on the same page with your producers,DJ\u2019s, and agents is one way to be successful. Drakes group is the OVO team He tries to do new things all the time in his music, and he is built up so if they don\u2019t like him then he hopes Future (his DJ/Producer) will do in his memory\n\nAlso a double entendre. Future is the name of his DJ and is related to time. If Drake dies and doesn\u2019t get so see what he\u2019ll become, like Pac, he hopes that he\u2019ll be remembered in the future. You aren\u2019t supposed to be surprised when you can do things so easily, He is everything you aren\u2019t.\n\nHe\u2019s asking how is he suppose to look when is eyes are closed. Also he\u2019s saying how is he gonna look up to an idol when rapping and this life he\u2019s in comes so easy, he doesn\u2019t need that kind of inspiration from somewhere else. Drake is always thinking of new ideas for his songs, better watch the door so you know when he comes, he succeeded past his idols so he has no one to look up too. The girls know its DRIZZY. Drake is busy with his career He blows his money but he never runs out. He is a star and he will never go away for a long time He showed his city his talent that they probably wouldn\u2019t have known about and he put Toronto on the map. Drake has done everything on his own and considers himself a king because he has reached the top "},{"album": {"api_path": "/albums/33273", "name": "Extra Lasers", "artist": {"name": "Lupe Fiasco", "url": "http://genius.com/artists/Lupe-fiasco", "iq": 1385.0, "image_url": "https://images.rapgenius.com/c3bf9f7adba5a0603bf9ad7b63f91489.304x304x1.jpg", "is_verified": true, "id": 147}, "url": "http://genius.com/albums/Lupe-fiasco/Extra-lasers", "cover_art_url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/rapgenius/Lupe_Fiasco_Extra_Lasers-front-large.jpg", "id": 33273}, "song_id": 6012, "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 0, "transcribers": 0, "contributors": 26, "iq_earners": 26, "accepted_annotations": 31, "hot": false, "verified_annotations": 0}, "artist": {"name": "Lupe Fiasco", "url": "http://genius.com/artists/Lupe-fiasco", "iq": 1385.0, "image_url": "https://images.rapgenius.com/c3bf9f7adba5a0603bf9ad7b63f91489.304x304x1.jpg", "is_verified": true, "id": 147}, "pyongs_count": 2, "title": "Who Are You Now", "annotations": "\u201cWhatever is profound loves masks\u201d \u2013 Nietzsche\n\nFrom the Lasers cutting-room floor (and yet \u2013 so much better than several songs on the album!)\n\nLupe released the song in its unfinished state, with space for a third verse in the song.

She is portrayed as a follower, not a leader. Following, finding, trying on and buying the latest \u2018trends\u2019 is time consuming (and limits the time you have to think about other things).\n\nThe image I get from this line, is the line up for a fitting room: This whole verse describes a girl going through life, using clothing to represent her different stages. At this stage, she is unable to find herself. Goodwill Industries is a charity based organization. This is a poke at the notion that, in today\u2019s world, you need to be beautiful in order to be somebody. But our idea of beautiful is plastered with make-up so you can\u2019t even see the true beauty of a person. While drunk she became a different person Her life as a stripper and prostitute has turned her out, and she has been abused by men so much that she has turned gay, which is what is meant by \u201cshe walk around in niggas clothes\u201d To be burnt out means to be exhausted and tired of life. The girl in the story is, burnt out from her hardships and drug use\n\nThis line also sets up the Richard Pryor one below, where a cocaine freebasing incident literally caused him to set himself on fire.

It isn\u2019t drugs that are causing Joe Budden to act unlike himself.  Budden got himself clean, and this verse is about a possible relapse.

He half-condones, half-condemns the typical \u201cslacker\u201d lifestyle; right off the bat, he reads the definition, laughing at what is considered to be a \u201cslacker,\u201d but then says that life is just about having fun. He raps about lazy people always having excuses as to why they don\u2019t have a job, but also raps from a first-person perspective which seems a little too similar to Tech himself sometimes. It seems as though Tech N9ne feels life shouldn\u2019t be wasted, but also feels that \u201cslackers\u201d are unjustly attacked for their way of life.\n\nThe whole song could be interpreted in multiple ways, especially since it could be seen as rapping about lazy people and their traits, or Tech could be sarcastically rapping about how people view him. Slackers are good for nothing! Tech N9ne is saying that since he is almost famous he doesn\u2019t need a job other than rapping and that the people offering said jobs can \u201cshove them up their anus\u201d or forget about him accepting the job. What do you want from him? He has no money for you. He doesn\u2019t pay taxes due to the fact he doesn\u2019t have a job and the only source of income he does have is most likely illegal and therefore he doesn\u2019t get taxed on that either. Tech is saying he gets so drunk he isn\u2019t able to safely drive home or may get into a fight at the club and can only hope he gets home safely without a bad incident occurring. Tech wakes up and smokes weed, a popular activity practiced by stoners which they call \u201cwake n' bake\u201d. Tech references a JAY Z line from his track \u201cThings That U Do\u201d.\n\nReaganomics was an economic plan to lower social support and increase military support by the government. It helped the rich get richer while not benefiting the poor, leading to some turning to crime to better their situations. Tech is saying that he a product of this.\n\n\n\nAlso check out Rap vs. Ronald Reagan and Killer Mike\u2019s track \u201cReagan\u201d. \u201cEat, drink, and be merry, for tomorrow we die\u201d is rather common expression, meaning to enjoy life while you can, because you never know when you\u2019re gonna go.\n\n\n\nThe expression originate from a combination of two biblical phrases.\n\n\n\nEcclesiastes 8:15:\n\nThen I commended mirth, because a man hath no better thing under the sun, than to eat, and to drink, and to be merry\n\n\nIsaiah 22:13:\n\nLet us eat and drink; for tomorrow we shall die.\u2019 Tech N9ne has a diverse fanbase, consisting of white, native Indian, Mexican, and black people.\n\n\n\nHowever, eventually some of his black fans falsely accused Tech N9ne of being a devil worshipper because of his unusual appearance (Tech is famous for his long, red spiked hair) and dark (sometimes borderline horrorcore) content.\n\n\n\nAlso check out the lyrics to \u201cMessage to the Black Man\u201d and \u201cCome Gangsta\u201d. At the time Tech wrote this song, he wasn\u2019t nearly as paid as he is today, therefore his friends would have to pee his fees at clubs.\n\nThings have changed since 2002. From Forbes Cash Kings 2013: The World\u2019s 20 Highest-Paid Hip-Hop Artists:\n\n\n18. Tech N9ne ($7.5 million)\n\nKansas City isn\u2019t known for hip-hop, but Tech N9ne is putting the Midwest on the rap map. His empire includes label Strange Music as well as his own recording studio, merch company and touring infrastructure. For more, see \u201cTech N9ne: Hip-Hop\u2019s Secret Mogul.\u201d\n\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=o3wP3Mrwx7k Back in 2002, Tech was just trying to blow up in the ranks of hip-hop, at Master P\u2019s level. Throughout the 90s, Master P\u2019s label No Limit Records was huge\u2013there were many multi-platinum artists signed to label, which churned out several albums each month.\n\nFast-forward to today, and it seems like Tech has achieved his goal. He\u2019s considered the most successful independent rapper of all time, having built his label Strange Music from the ground up and selling over 1 million albums by 2008. He needs money bad, but he still would rather sit at his house and watch TV with not a dime to his name (no pun intended), and he\u2019s still feared and respected anyway.\n\nTech also references illegal downloading; this song was released in 2002, around the time when lots of artists felt like they weren\u2019t getting the profits they deserved due to the new, easy way to get music for free (think Lars Ulrich), in addition to the RIAA being actively against illegal downloading.\n\nCoincidentally, Tech N9ne\u2019s campaign in response to the anti-downloading movement, \u201cFTI,\u201d is said to have caused Absolute Power\u2019s sales to have tripled, even though the campaign included putting a free download of the album on the Strange Music website. He doesn\u2019t have a job and probably no family that cares about him, so holidays are no different from his daily dicking around. A reworking of a part of the first verse of \u201cHypnotize\u201d by Biggie Smalls, redone to fit the \u201cslacker\u201d tone of the song. In this case, \u201cgripping his piece\u201d would refer to walking around grabbing his nuts as opposed to having his hand on his gun, and wearing a cheap knock-off fleece. In this line, Tech is quoting Jim Morrison (RIP),  the vocalist of the rock-and-roll band The Doors.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSlXjrxqDOE\n\nTech\u2019s inspiration behind his label Strange Music came from The Doors' music and references their song names (\u201cPeople Are Strange\u201d, \u201cStrange Days\u201d).\n\n10 years after this song was released, Tech was finally able to record his dream collaboration with the remaining members of The Doors on a reworking of \u201cStrange Days\u201d called \u201cStrange 2013\u201d that is on his 2013 album \u201cSomething Else.\"\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vz5jT1RSHLg If you act a fool, you\u2019re gonna get your teeth knocked out. Two-fifths of vodka He states that he is chilling all day all night and does whatever he feels like. He is poor and take one day at a time, not concerning to much about the future This line could have different meanings, as it could be talking about the \u201cvictim complex\u201d outlook that a lot of \u201cslackers\u201d are said to have about the world, always talking about how their life sucks because the rest of the world made it that way, but it could just sarcastically be saying that Tech is living a great life, and it doesn\u2019t suck at all to be someone who raps and parties for a living. People who tell him to \u201cget a job\u201d are the people who are corrupting the world in his eyes.\n\n\u201cHit a knob\u201d could be a double entendre here for people to blow him, or to make music (think the knobs on a sound mixer) as that\u2019s his way of making money. He sleeps all day, and parties at night. He\u2019s trying to get noticed with his music. This line is similar, and may be quoting, The Beastie Boys. He\u2019s never going to get a job and be someone\u2019s \u201cwork horse.\u201d \u201cBleeze\u201d is referring to a \u201cblunt\u201d, (marijuana wrapped in a bluntwrap). Him and his crew are always in trouble with police, because they don\u2019t have their licenses, and the cars are probably stolen. Tech N9ne used to go through some crazy styles, and he was labeled as a juggalo or just odd to those who felt alienated by it. He claims that everyone else that lives responsibly is a lame, but the irony is he just sits at home playing video games. He\u2019s just another guy who tries to get by using a gun to rob you and take your money, even if you don\u2019t have a lot on you. A Shock G line from Tupac\u2019s I Get Around. Tech\u2019s outfits aren\u2019t expensive, and you can tell, Tech biting this line and many more in the song goes with the whole theme of being a slacker and makes the song more funny! He admits he doesn\u2019t lead the life of what people consider \u201cnormal\u201d, and, therefore, they label him as a \u201cslacker\u201d. He wants to hang out with his friends and see a concert, but he doesn\u2019t have any money to spend. So, he sneaks in without a ticket, (probably through the back), trips, and makes the band and security stop the show. \u201cDeuce\u201d means peace, as in, say goodbye to your money, if you have any. He has to leave in a hurry, because he didn\u2019t pay for a ticket, and the cops are on the way. The police try to subdue him, but he hits one and gets arrested. He needs \u201cbail\u201d money to get out of jail, but his parents won\u2019t send him any. He claims he doesn\u2019t understand the world, but then proceeds to explain why girls love high-rollers as opposed to nine-to-five guys who can barely make it through their miserable drone job, therefore having a considerable amount of understanding of how our world works. Here, Tech\u2019s telling everyone that life isn\u2019t about doing what others say, or what you feel obligated to do, it\u2019s about doing what YOU want to do. And, it doesn\u2019t always involve money. Even though he\u2019s what some call \u201codd\u201d, he\u2019s truthful with his work. He doesn\u2019t go mainstream like a lot of other rappers. To be \u201cneurotic\u201d, means that you\u2019re mentally distressed, or plain out crazy. You may hallucinate, and or schizophrenic. People are calling Tech neurotic, because his style\u2019s not what they\u2019re used to, and he\u2019s often referred to as \u201cbizarre\u201d or \u201ccrazy\u201d.

Hollow tips are a special type of bullet that expands upon impact. To ensure maximum damage upon impact, the bullet folds back and speads out into pieces like shrapnel. Ouch! Watch your mouth because 50 could be shoving one in it! Even though he makes millions from music, Fiddy still deals cocaine on the side as an extra source of income.

If you say the wrong thing, you will face the consequences. \u2018Touched\u2019 is street slang for getting shot.\n\nGetting touched could also mean being arrested. You blend in or the police pick you up. 50 doesn\u2019t need anybody to support him; he made it on his own 2 feet. Some injuries (mainly a wounded leg or knee) require the victim to use crutches to support them whilst walking. I wonder if Fiddy was on crutches after being shot 9 times\u2026 Steez is street slang that describes one\u2019s style or swagger. It originated from legendary Hip Hop duo Gang Starr\u2019s song, \u201cYou Know My Steez\u201d. People know how 50 rolls, and don\u2019t want to get on the wrong end of him. \u201cWet up your whip\u201d is a slang for doing damage to somebody\u2019s car.

If you stuff around and mishandle 50\u2019s money (grip), he will bust a cap at you. 50\u2019s workers are importing and exporting drugs 24/7. 50 is describing the stereotypical lifestyle in California: pretty bitches and palm tree infested beaches! 50 doesn\u2019t like counterfeit jewels; he only rocks the freshest bling. A little house shopping? Not when your house looks like this!\n\n\n\nInteresting fact: 50 bought legendary boxer Mike Tyson\u2019s 50,000 square foot, 52 room mansion from Tyson\u2019s ex-wife, Monica Turner for around 4.1 million dollars. This is the type of music you relax to in your fancy Maybach vehicle. 50\u2019s status is as big as King Kong in the streets. He is a force to be reckoned with.\n\n\n\nI can totally see the resemblance! Fiddy plans to takeover the West Coast and settle down there. 50 has already taken over the East Coast, but he isn\u2019t gonna stop there. Fiddy is going worldwide! \u201c30 Carats on the pinky\u201d refers to the ring he has on his pinky finger.\nIt\u2019s funny to mention the word \u201cDon\u201d, because the Italian Mafia members are known for the tradition of wearing pinky rings. 50\u2019s using the money he gets in California to shoot pornos\u2026 Ruger is a popular kind of pistol.\n\n50 doesn\u2019t take any chances while driving through the hood.

There are 4.099 models out there, so we guess it\u2019s fair to say it\u2019s pretty rare.\n\n\n\nAnd just to prove to you that he\u2019s even more of a boss, F-50 had his Murcielago custom-fitted with a retractable hardtop.

Pirellis is a brand of tires. 50 is rocking Pirellis rims on his Porsche. He also takes the metaphor from the previous into this line; he is an early bird. So early, in fact, he can hear chirping.

The Elizabethan era was the time period during which Queen Elizabeth I ruled England.\n\nThis period was particularly noted for the great fame that the theater scene earned, with dramas and some of the finest tragedies ever written (ex. being Hamlet) having been created in this period, along with rising to prominence.\n\nThe most famous playwright from the Elizabethan period is of course, none other than William Shakespeare. This is the beginning (the Genabis/Genesis), so remember his words as they are spoken. Discussing how the work compiles data and shows his illness. In the song, he shows why he is the best rapper and how he fits the ideal rap model. Nazca, Peru is a city in none other than the country Peru.\n\nCanibus is referring to the Nazca Lines, which are geoglyphs located in the Nazca desert.\n\nAn example of the referenced drawings: The volts burn your eyes, and the eyeballs will be completely burned, allowing you to figuratively see the fire.

Comparing himself to the Rosetta stone, which contain a piece of writing in several ancient languages.

Canibus already knows what his opponents want to do to him, but it won\u2019t happen. An example of an antithesis.\n\nCanibus is like the Neil Armstrong of Hip Hop, whereas he accomplishes something with an even greater magnitude (by orbiting the Sun).\n\nThen he compares his rhymes to a Red Giant which is the pinnacle stage in stellar evolution.

He is saying he created wordplay and the art of rhyming, comparing it to God\u2019s creation of the universe.\n\nGenesis also starts with \u2018in the beginning\u2019.\n\nIn the beginning God created the heavens and the earth Double entendre\n\n1: Canibus is free to spit on any mic.\n\n2: A reference to his feud with LL Cool J.

Let me borrow that.\n\nLL  replied with a diss on 4,3,2,1 despite Canibus agreeing to remove his bars about borrowing the mic and said:\n\nThe symbol on my arm is off limits to challengers.\n\nHowever, Bis believes his diss track response \u201cSecond Round KO\u201d won him the battle and proved he was worthy of sharing the mic with LL.

It also incorporates piano and brass (see 2:05).\n\nDr. Dre also produced album track \u201cFire\u201d.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl90_vSz0jk This is a nod to \u2018\u2019Just Be Good To Me\u2018\u2019 performed by The S.O.S.

You can hear this line said at 1:52.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=khj9jyNvhpQ He makes money by rapping (spitting) about real stuff, this was proven when his debut album Get Rich or Die Tryin' and second album The Massacre peaked at #1 for U.S. Billboard 200.\n\n50 Cent is one of best selling rap artists in history, selling over 40 million records to this date. Numbers don\u2019t lie\u2026\n\nI did what he did in 15 years in 4 years. Like the numbers? You don\u2019t wanna talk about the numbers. Money and fame attracts females, when he drives in his Mercedes your girl will get manipulated by him.\n\n50 Cent is known for purchasing many luxury cars such as Bentley\u2019s, Lamborghini\u2019s and Rolls-Royce\u2019s.\n\nCheckout 50 Cent\u2019s blue car collection\u2026 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YF0XrAphYc Play on words by saying \u201cshiddit\u201d instead of shit and \u201cwiddig\u201d instead of wig (keeping up with the rhyme scheme).\n\nTo \u201csplit\u201d someone\u2019s wig is to shoot them in the head, therefore 50 has shot the person he\u2019s had a dispute with. This might be a diss to Game.\n\nGame was involved in a feud with 50 Cent which resulted in him being dropped the Aftermath and G-Unit. Game\u2019s debut album The Documentary was boosted by three 50 Cent features, which shows the level of assistance 50 Cent provided Game. 50 Cent was \u201cfound\u201d by Eminem, which resulted in him getting signed to Aftermath (found by Dr Dre) and Shady Records (found by Eminem).\n\nEminem was found by Dr Dre, 50 Cent was found by Eminem\u2026 50 is the point of attention when he arrives anywhere, including the club. Also a reference to In Da Club. He\u2019s outdone everyone that started beef with him. He\u2019s already told you not to confront him or you\u2019ll be the next victim.\n\nDon\u2019t go against me I\u2019ll hurt your feelings 50 enjoys intercourse with grown women, unlike R Kelly\u2026 A condominium is when a part of an estate is individually owned by different people. 50 Cent has so much money that he can purchase the whole estate rather than a specific part.\n\n50 Cent\u2019s house\u2026 Double Entendre:\n1. In 2000, 50 Cent was shot 9 times but survived. Later that year his alleged shooter, Darryl \u201cHommo\u201d Baum, was shot dead. 50 Cent has suggested that Darryl\u2019s death was linked to his shooting, thus he can get anyone killed by breathing (talking).\n\nCause he got hit like I got hit, but he ain\u2019t fucking breathing\n\n\n2. 50 Cent was born to rap, every time he breathes (raps) he makes killings (successful records). A reference to P.I.M.P. Just like he said on P.I.M.P, he has a lot of females trying to attract his attention (for money and fame). Double Entendre:\n1. James Brown is a major influential American artist who is also known as \u201cThe Godfather of Soul\u201d. 50 Cent is hinting that he is as influential and success as the legend James Brown.\n\n2. James Brown died on December 25th 2006, this album (Curtis) was released in 2007. 50 Cent is literally a James Brown but he has a soul (is alive) unfortunately unlike Brown.\n\n50 Cent also attended Brown\u2019s public memorial service in New York. 50 Cent\u2019s debut studio album managed to sell 872,000 copes in the first week, which charted at number one on U.S. billboard 200. His second studio album The Massacre also charted at number one by selling over 1.14 million copies in the first week.\n\n50 Cent can make commercially successful records while connecting with gangsters who listen to him, which is something not a lot of artists can do. Double Entendre???\n1. In addition to being an artist, 50 Cent is also known as a successful entrepreneur (\u201cbiz\u201d is slang for business), founding personal projects such as SMS Audio and SK Energy. He has also teamed up with major companies such as Reebok (to distribute G-Unit Sneakers) and Coca-Cola (sold the formula for the vitamin water \u201cFormula 50\u201d).\n\n2. 50 Cent has been involved in many disputes with rappers such as Ja Rule and Game. The word \u201cbiz\u201d also sounds like \u201cbusy\u201d, which supports 50 Cent as he\u2019s always in drama with rappers. Everyone\u2019s doubts about 50 Cent not being successful as an artist was washed away when he released the single \u201cIn Da Club\u201d, which was the single for his debut album Get Rich or Die Tryin'.\n\nIn Da Club has sold over 2,000,000 copies to this date while Get Rich or Die Tryin' sold over 872,000 copies in the first week and over 12,000,000 copies to this date (making it the fourth highest selling rap album in the US).\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still sipping the bub\u201d is a reference to;\n\nYou can find me in the club, bottle full of bub' 50 Cent is well known for being a master of making radio hits. At this point, he had put out 3 #1 singles (just in the US);\n\u2018'In Da Club\u2019', \u2018'21 Questions\u2019' and \u2018'Candy Shop\u2019'.

Sentant son corps se vider par les nombreuses plaies, le sang gonflant les veines oculaires, sa derni\u00e8re vision sera la terre qu'il pr\u00e9f\u00e9ra ne jamais conna\u00eetre, o\u00f9 les survivants seront vendus comme des animaux. Conscient qu'on lui a vol\u00e9 toute raison de vivre, il en arrive au point de pr\u00e9f\u00e9rer la mort au fait de n'\u00eatre qu'un outil (fant\u00f4me) de travail \u00e0 la cha\u00eene. Malgr\u00e9 leur courage qui a valeur d'exemple, les d\u00e9tenus se font violemment stopper dans leur lanc\u00e9e par des armes qui leur \u00e9taient inconnues jusque l\u00e0 (Les b\u00e2tons crachant du feu = fusils \u00e0 poudre).\n\n\n\nEt, c'est apr\u00e8s que son corps soit victime de moult s\u00e9vices qu'il finit par comprendre que la mort est la seule issue qui se pr\u00e9sente aux mutins. C'est le moment choisi pour se r\u00e9volter selon Kunta !\nIl hurle \u00e0 ses comp\u00e8res d'infortune qu'il est temps de prendre le contr\u00f4le du bateau (le Mandingue est une langue utilis\u00e9e par sa tribu).\nL'agitation s'empare brutalement du n\u00e9grier o\u00f9 les esclaves semblent avoir pris l'avantage. Malgr\u00e9 le fait que les \u201cn\u00e8gres\u201d vivaient dans des conditions infectes et d\u00e9gradantes, il fallait tout de m\u00eame que ceux-ci entretiennent leur physique, histoire que les marchands en tirent un bon prix.\nDonc chaque jour ils devaient s\u2019exercer sur le pont du navire. On sait ici que le n\u00e9grier se nomme le Lord Ligonier, fameux vaisseau de la (r\u00e9elle) marine am\u00e9ricaine qui est associ\u00e9 au roman dont Kunta est le personnage central.\nLa destin\u00e9e de ces esclaves est de cultiver les champs de coton du nouveau continent.\nUn Case d\u00e9part en moins dr\u00f4le dirons-nous.\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTyXiVc5jjo Une maxime dit\n\nA la guerre comme \u00e0 la guerre.\n\nEt la Traite n\u00e9gri\u00e8re a, comme tous conflits, g\u00e9n\u00e9r\u00e9 des crimes, qu'ils soient de sang ou sexuels.\nAinsi, prisonnier des Blancs, Kunta s'interroge sur ces derniers.\n\n\nPeut-on croire en un dieu tout en se conduisant comme les pires assassins du monde ?\nPeut-on avoir une famille et violer sans remords de l'autre c\u00f4t\u00e9 de l'oc\u00e9an ?\nPeut-on se conduire comme des animaux alors qu'on pr\u00f4ne un mode de vie bas\u00e9 sur le respect ?\n\n\n\nC'est triste quand on se rend compte qu'\u00e0 toutes ces questions la r\u00e9ponse est\n#OUI\u2026 Au fond, peu lui importe o\u00f9 se trouve le navire, ce qu'il compte faire c'est renvoyer le bateau d'o\u00f9 il vient (les c\u00f4tes gambiennes).\nOu, \u00e0 d\u00e9faut, avant d\u2019accoster sur \u201cles terres blanches\u201d, tout faire pour que l'embarcation s'enfonce sous les flots. Kounta a perdu tous ses rep\u00e8res depuis sa capture, d\u00e9boussol\u00e9 il se demande o\u00f9 en est le bateau, il essaye difficilement de se rappeler depuis combien de jours il est captif. Voici les conditions hygi\u00e9niques des cales d'un n\u00e9grier. Du coup ceux qui arrivaient vivants \u00e0 destination n'\u00e9taient autres que les plus r\u00e9sistants.\nUne strat\u00e9gie de rentabilit\u00e9 de la part des commer\u00e7ants. Apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9tait assomm\u00e9, notre h\u00e9ros reprit connaissance alors qu'il se trouvait sur la passerelle du n\u00e9grier\n\n\n\nCette b\u00eate est l'oiseau blanc dont il est question au d\u00e9but du texte, celui dont il a r\u00eav\u00e9 avec terreur.\nIl se trouve donc dans un cauchemar, bien r\u00e9el. M\u00e9dine conclut ce morceau en citant diff\u00e9rentes tribus d'Afrique.\nEt, au fond, nous sommes tous enfants d'un destin, vivant dans un pr\u00e9sent qui est le r\u00e9sultat des guerres du pass\u00e9. M\u00e9dine a r\u00e9dig\u00e9 une s\u00e9rie (de 4 morceaux) qu'il nomme Enfant du destin pour parler du v\u00e9cu d'un personnage face \u00e0 un \u00e9v\u00e8nement historique pr\u00e9cis, il y a :\nEnfant du destin (David)\nEnfant du destin (Daoud)\nEnfant du destin (Petit Cheval)\nEnfant du destin (Sou Han)\nEt ce texte-ci. Malgr\u00e9 les tentatives de lib\u00e9ration par mutineries et marronnage la Traite n\u00e9gri\u00e8re durera 400 ans, et 400 ans c'est trop long A bout de force; d\u00e9sesp\u00e9r\u00e9, il s'abandonne dans des pas hasardeux qui le conduisent l\u00e0 o\u00f9 il ne pourrait se rep\u00e9rer. D\u00e9sorient\u00e9, il est finalement brutalement rattrap\u00e9 par ses chasseurs. Incompr\u00e9hension de la part de Kunta qui en vient \u00e0 m\u00e9priser ces \u201cautres n\u00e8gres\u201d qui se sont rang\u00e9s du c\u00f4t\u00e9 des europ\u00e9ens pour faciliter les captures du fait de leurs connaissances des territoires africains.\nCette collaboration s'effectuait car les tra\u00eetres recevaient en \u00e9change de leur contribution un miroir, qui \u00e9tait pour eux un objet de sorcellerie plein de pouvoirs.\nMais, une fois toutes les tribus captur\u00e9es, ces m\u00eames \u201cn\u00e8gres\u201d seront pris comme denr\u00e9e humaine \u00e0 leur tour.\n\nEn somme\n\nL'arroseur arros\u00e9 Il r\u00e9torque comme il peut, saisit h\u00e2tivement une pierre ramass\u00e9e sur le chemin et la lance avec violence sur l'un de ses poursuivants. Les commer\u00e7ants d\u00e9cident d'utiliser leur fouet pour l'affaiblir, le premier coup lui h\u00f4te ses affaires tandis que le second lui arrache un morceau de peau.\nLa douleur se fait donc ressentir La poursuite d\u00e9bute !\nPar chance, la crosse du fusil du colon (objet lourd) n'a pas eu raison de lui, il continue donc son escapade.\n\nMais l'attaque est organis\u00e9e de la part des blancs, les sorties sont donc peu nombreuses.\n\nOn note ici une antanaclase : le mot merci est employ\u00e9 deux fois, mais avec une connotation diff\u00e9rente. L'impression de D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu est une r\u00e9f\u00e9rence aux premi\u00e8res lignes du texte, moment qu'il a r\u00eav\u00e9.\nPlus de signe du chien qui le guidait, \u00e0 la place, une odeur tellement particuli\u00e8re qu'elle le pousse \u00e0 se m\u00e9fier.\nNi une, ni deux, son instinct le renforce sur son intuition, ce sont les colons qui viennent se servir dans les populations voisines.\nIl faut fuir !\n\n\n\nRapprochement entre esclavagiste et animal avec l'odeur du poulet mouill\u00e9. Cette comparaison fait relativiser l'approche de la notion de Sauvagerie Comme toute personne sur Terre, l'envie de d\u00e9couvrir de nouvelles terres trotte dans sa t\u00eate. Que ce soit un enrichissement culturel ou spirituel, il le d\u00e9sire. Durant la qu\u00eate des mat\u00e9riaux n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 l'\u00e9laboration du tambour Kunta est accompagn\u00e9 d'un chien qui sert d'\u00e9claireur dans un d\u00e9cor bucolique et calme\u2026 trop calme L'enfant a le don d'\u00eatre curieux, et Kunta essaye de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 ses questionnements autant qu'il le peut.\nMais devant s'atteler \u00e0 d'autres t\u00e2ches, il d\u00e9cide d'occuper son fr\u00e8re avec un tambour dont il s'empresse d'aller chercher les mat\u00e9riaux qui le constitueront.\n\n\n\nCi-dessus deux djemb\u00e9s. Maintenant qu'il est un homme confirm\u00e9 il se doit d'assister sa m\u00e8re dans les activit\u00e9s familiales, notamment s'occuper de son petit fr\u00e8re qu'il semble appr\u00e9cier. Dans les populations primitives le rite de passage qui fait de l'enfant un adulte est souvent li\u00e9 \u00e0 la chasse d'o\u00f9 le lance-pierre transmis de g\u00e9n\u00e9ration en g\u00e9n\u00e9ration.\nDe plus cet \u00e9loignement permet \u00e0 l'individu d'\u00e9voluer avec ses pens\u00e9es et de cultiver sa spiritualit\u00e9.\nLa lutte est enfin une occupation oblig\u00e9e dans les tribus, ne serait-ce que pour d\u00e9fendre les autres habitants du village. Cadre de naissance (lieu, tribu, parents) Vision spirituelle des habitants : le respect de la Nature, et l'animisme, qui est le fait de croire en l'existence d'une entit\u00e9 r\u00e9sidant dans les objets.\n\nIl est important de souligner que la tribu des Mandingues habitant Djouffour\u00e9 est musulmane.\n\nSeulement, les croyances animistes et m\u00eame chamanistes ont subsist\u00e9 et ont fini par cohabiter avec l'Islam dans la foi des gens. Description de comportements qui y sont effectu\u00e9s\nLes divertissements sont litt\u00e9raires, cosmiques et temporels.\nParall\u00e8le vocal (Homophonie) entre se content & se comptent. Rappel de la position g\u00e9ographique du village de Kunta. Le fleuve principal du pays lui a donn\u00e9 son nom, il s'agit donc du Gambie.\n\n\n\nCelui-ci s'est nourri des pluies abondantes pour voir augmenter son volume, une crue qui n'a rien d'exceptionnel dans les zones tropicales. Quatre jours : c'est le temps qu'il faut pour voyager du village de Djouffour\u00e9 (actuel Kankan) jusqu'aux c\u00f4tes du continent africain, en barque africaine. M\u00e9dine \u00e9voque habilement la Traite n\u00e9gri\u00e8re qui se faisait sur toute la c\u00f4te Ouest de l'Afrique, et plus particuli\u00e8rement, ici, dans la ville de Djouffour\u00e9, situ\u00e9e en Gambie, comme il est \u00e9crit dans le roman d'Alex Haley.\n\n\n\n\u201cL'Oiseau blanc\u201d \u00e9tant un terme utilis\u00e9 pour d\u00e9signer le colonisateur esclavagiste blanc.\n\nC'est une animalisation des esclavagistes europ\u00e9ens, reflet de l'aspect inhumain de leurs actes, \u00e0 travers l'oiseau blanc (m\u00e9taphore du bateau) qui voyagerait aux gr\u00e8s des vents, d'un continent \u00e0 l'autre, pour se nourrir (en main d'oeuvre) et ainsi s'enrichir ais\u00e9ment. Il est d\u00e9termin\u00e9 \u00e0 ne pas \u00eatre une proie, il redouble alors d'effort, m\u00eame si la verdure devient de plus en plus dense, et lui rend ainsi la d\u00e9marche plus difficile.\n\n\n\nA force de fuir et de courir, il vient s\u00fbrement d'atteindre la savane, qui fait contraste avec la brousse cit\u00e9e pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, par son c\u00f4t\u00e9 dense et verdoyant. A bout de souffle, il sent son corps qui s'\u00e9puise.\n\nNotez la pr\u00e9sence du verbe \u201ccoloniser\u201d que l'on peut associer aux noms communs \u201cdrame\u201d et \u201cmal\u00e9diction\u201d.\n\nRenvoyant ainsi \u00e0 la conqu\u00eate des terres d'Afrique par les blancs (colonisateurs) ; pour certains la colonisation est v\u00e9cue comme une horreur \u00e0 maudire. M\u00eame avec les pieds \u00e9corch\u00e9s et fatigu\u00e9s, cet \u201cEnfant du Destin\u201d continue sa fuite, pensant \u00eatre pourchass\u00e9, depuis le lev\u00e9 du jour (l'aube), par un animal sauvage.\n\n\n\nLa brousse \u00e9tant une v\u00e9g\u00e9tation caract\u00e9ristique du climat tropical, essentiellement compos\u00e9e d'arbustes et de petites plantes herbac\u00e9es plut\u00f4t s\u00e8ches. Mise en place du contexte.\n\n\n\nLe texte sera \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re personne, pr\u00e9sentant l'aventure d'une personne qui chasse dans les for\u00eats.\n\nOn apprend dans la phrase suivante qu'il chasse pieds nus, et on suppose, sans protections. La Gambie est un pays d'Afrique de l'Ouest enclav\u00e9 dans le S\u00e9n\u00e9gal, au bord de l'Oc\u00e9an Atlantique.\n\n\n\nOn apprend donc ici que cet \u201cEnfant du Destin\u201d est un Mandigue du territoire Gambien. En 1750, au moment des faits, la population Mandigue s'\u00e9tendait de la C\u00f4te d'Ivoire jusqu'\u00e0 la Gambie.\n\nGuerrier noir, de la tribu des Mandingues\n\n\n\n  \n\n\nM\u00e9dine nous pr\u00e9sente imm\u00e9diatement la situation dans laquelle se trouvait le personnage au d\u00e9but de l'histoire : il \u00e9tait pauvre, sans chaussures, ce qui explique que ses pieds soient \u00e9corch\u00e9s ; il se d\u00e9pla\u00e7ait pieds nus, \u00e0 m\u00eame la terre.

Grime hit its peak with Dizzee Rascal breaking mainstream. It died down a little and Devlin helped bring it back to be relatively popular again. A lot of rappers in mainstream, they shouldn\u2019t be rappers because they can\u2019t speak properly. This is Devlin\u2019s view. This is self-explanatory; even if you don\u2019t like Devlin, you have to admit that he is a great emcee. Devlin is known to spit quick and he is so lyrical that it is sometimes hard to keep up with the pace He\u2019s at the top of rap This is how long it will take him to finish the freestyle. (64 bars) He\u2019s one of the best in the grime scene. He won\u2019t try and save or help you Giraffe\u2019s necks are long No one can kill Devlin with the use of words He want\u2019s everyone to know that he\u2019s better than you Devlin is so heavy that he is too much for the scales whereas his competition are so lightweight they can\u2019t be registered Kojak is a US TV series whose star Theo Kojak is a detective Anybody who says that they are on the same level of talent as Devlin will be quickly shown otherwise Probably a good idea to avoid the road to Zion then Ancient disease is being used in two ways here:\n\nFirstly he will kill off all his haters like an ancient disease\nSecondly his name has spread like the plague one of the most infamously widespread illnesses in English history Only six years ago he was relatively unknown but still putting out work like this clip from 2007 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNf3-rRS4b0 Talking greasy = talking smack Early on Devlin gained success with heartfelt tracks like \u201cCommunity Outcast\u201d that show his emotional side. He is saying other artists in the UK scene have followed this example He will bury his opponents so deep they will be able to meet the grim reaper who lives in hell.\nWhile there they might as well say high to the demons who Devlin has apparently dealt with in his rough life. He runs his shit , no one can take his life in their hands.\nAlso referring to the craft of writing Jim is Devlin\u2019s nickname as his real name is James Devlin.

These bars contain a bunch of clever double entendres. A cigarette will \u2018hurt\u2019 someone internally by giving them cancer, or some other illness, whilst Dev will hurt them emotionally with his brutal honesty. Cigarettes are addictive by nature, so people can\u2019t \u2018put them down\u2019, whereas Dev is saying he\u2019s such a sick MC people can\u2019t put him down, i.e. write off his skills.

As MellowHype, they concentrate on smoking weed and hating cops.\n\n\u201cFuck the Police\u201d is Left Brain\u2019s ode to Lex Luger. It was renamed \u201cF666 the Police\u201d on the BlackenedWhite 2011 re-release. Tyler does not respect the white cop. Tyler can\u2019t see out of his windshield so he ran into a couple of dear on accident. He wants to out-speed the police and therefore escape them, but the road isn\u2019t empty so it\u2019s easy for the cops to catch him. Fuck the police! Unfortunately for Tyler, the police officer is arriving. Left Brain\u2019s got 6 clips duct taped together so he\u2019ll be able to shoot lots of bullets quickly. Leftbrain is willing to sodomize a female cop\u2026willingly. Rapping Half Of MellowHype And the Third Member In OFWGKTA. The SKS is a type of rifle. Waka Flocka is also a fan of this gun (killing cops on the weekend you two?), as he says in Hard in Da Paint. RIVERDAAAAALEEEEE. As for the lyric, I\u2019m assuming he gave your CEO the SK for dinner and well, he might have forgot to floss those bullets out his brain.  Left Brain rarely raps. This is a special occasion. While he\u2019s cracking his head open, he\u2019s also got him in a head lock. Here their sentiments on the police are fully expressed As in \u201corganized crime\u201d, which he explains in the next line. Hodgy is confident because he\u2019s hardcore as fuck. A DT is a detective. Hodgy is kidnapping one, and crucifying him. The crucifixion reference also refers to Odd Future\u2019s sacrilegious tendencies. He plans on stealing a vehicle, maybe the cop car to escape. The cop tries to intimidate Tyler, ordering him out of his swagged-up batmobile to get sent to the police station, where he will eventually be tried and sent to prison.\nWhen questioned about it, the cop doesn\u2019t even try to deny that he just wants to see Tyler suffer, being stabbed and cornholed in prison. Tyler, being the straight up G that he is, refuses to take this cop\u2019s shit and puts four rounds into him. Tyler was just chillin', practicing his skateboard tricks (remember, OF is made up of skaters) and then the cops had to run up on him\n\nThis seems to contradict the beginning of the track where he ran over some animals and pedestrians\u2026\n\nTyler often complains that his rap career has rendered him \u201cbarely able to do a kickflip\u201d As we probably all know by now, this refers to Odd Future Wolf Gang Just by coincidence (co-winky-dink) Tyler happens to be everything racist, white cops hate and fear:Not only is he a tall, scary black man, he\u2019s also a rapper (the cop could probably infer this from Tyler owning a Batmobile; you basically have to be a rapper to afford a whip like that) Coffins are buried six feet underground The police aren\u2019t interested in serving justice-even though Tyler started his verse by committing the crime of hitting a couple people. They\u2019re just trying to beat his ass for fun For the record, it\u2019s not a good idea to say this to a cop. Just puttin' that out there He really wants to direspect authority figures. Fuck the pigs. he\u2019s saying that all the cops who tried to lock him up are dead now wont think twice about bustin a cap at the police and killing them Hodgy is getting his knife and bat to bring. Hodgy and the crew pulled up in their trucks and were carried off in buses. When people are arrested and their are too many of them, LAPD calls for buses to come pick them up. The police call for back up when \u201ca man is down\u201d which means the police officer has been hurt or shot po-po is a common used name for the police, in this case the police did not want to see Tyler practice his kickflips Tyler shot the police that were around, triple six round or (666) is the devil\u2019s number, but he is also referencing the six police officers he just killed.\n\nOn The reissue of the album this song is called F666 the Police. 11-99 means officer needs help Hodgy is wondering the police always stop them After he kills the one cop, the partner of the dead cop knows he\u2019s next up Hodgy isn\u2019t into petty crime, he\u2019s in the big leagues of organized crime and he\u2019ll kill your leader. Hodgy is an AVID weed smoker and enjoys OG Kush Tyler\u2019s tweeted he isn\u2019t homophobic, he just says homophobic things.. Real Rick Ross is \u201cFreeway\u201d Rick Ross, a notorious drug trafficker The LAPD have cemented a reputation for police brutality and racism. Fuck them. The \u201cgun sounds\u201d is a reference to another MellowHype song on the same album called Gun Sounds, but it\u2019s also just referring to Tyler\u2019s gun onomatopoeia a second ago.\n\nCould also refer to, \u201cLove Dem Gun Sounds,\u201d a song by Waka Flocka Flame Cops ask to see your license and registration when they pull you over.\n\nTyler uses his own voice, artificially deepened, to simulate a cop through this verse The batmobile is pretty fast. You\u2019d also imagine it\u2019s hard to steer, especially after a couple sprites Tyler is straight edge, so he parties like a 7-year old: lots of soda. A 22350 is someone who\u2019s speeding. So if you try and pull Left Brain over while he\u2019s speeding he won\u2019t stop. 211 as said, is a theft and penal codes sections 666 and 667; Section 666, known officially as petty theft with a prior so he\u2019s committing another theft after the robbery.\n\nAlso, this refers to OF\u2019s recurring use of of the number 666 in their lyrics. Cops usually work in pairs. After he kills a cop, he kills the other one and sends him off to heaven. 211 refers to:\n\n\nSteel Reserve beer, known for its high alcohol content and low price. The label says \u2018211\u2019 (apparently a medieval symbol for steel)\nThe LAPD code for armed robbery (as Eazy-E told us back in the day) After he shoots his gun and kills a cop, he drives off in his Humvee so he doesn\u2019t get caught\n\nI think the lyric is \u201cpop the glock, my bitch is uffie\u201d referencing Uffie\u2019s pop the glock http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eG-brC_NGNU Never stop hating on the cops 390 is someone who\u2019s drunk 51-50 is a mental case that refers to someone who is a danger to self and others. In other words your about to get into some wild ass shit\u2026 He dumps the body of the dead policemen out of his truck 417 is a person with a gun. He\u2019s a man with a gun and a bulletproof vest He does a drive by and commits a 207 (which in police scanner code is a kidnapping) and leaves an 11-24, which is an abandoned vehicle.\nShort version:he does a drive by kidnaps someone and leaves the car abandoned. Hodgy can\u2019t wait until a cop tries something on him.

He means this more in an \u201cayy papi\u201d sense. Put your ass in the air and start to scream. It sounds better in Spanish, trust me.

Note how he switches back to English to fit the rhyme scheme and mimicking the first line of the song. Part of what makes this song so unique is how he rhymes words of two different languages. Sunday morning here isn\u2019t actually about Sunday specifically. He means that after sex the night before, she is still ready to do it in the morning. Sunday morning just means any morning after sex. Bradley is such a caring guy that all it takes to turn him on is a kiss. It\u2019s not like he wants anything more than that. The sound is of an orgasm shout. Either he was incredibly fast in cumming or he was excited and leaked (a lot?) of precum. Pointing out the similarities between the head of the penis and a mushroom. Don\u2019t get caught lookin at Brad the wrong way, or he\u2019s gonna bust some caps (knee caps, that is).\n\nBatty is Jamaican slang for homosexual.

These haters are always concerned with his lifestyle and artistry to the the point they are metaphorically slobbin' on his knob His fans tell him he\u2019s one of the best and most serious rappers to ever enter the game. Because he is unlike most rappers, or artists in general, he has personal connections with his fans and he knows that they will never forget the times they spent together (I\u2019m speaking from personal experience) His fans asked for him to speak the truth and he delivered As biggie said \u201cwhat\u2019s beef?\u201d He wants to settle this with mics and show you who\u2019s better.\n\n*tearing someone a new asshole\n\nis a common slang term for extreme embarrassment. However he flips it, using a common slang phrase in today\u2019s society, \u201cno homo\u201d disregard the previous \u201cnice ass\u201d comment. Then he creates a double meaning:\n\n\nThey literally aren\u2019t gay\nHe don\u2019t get F\u2019d over or beat by anyone when it comes to rapping. A common theme MGK uses; In society it\u2019s believed that only the college educated are intelligent but despite the fact he didn\u2019t go to college. He doesn\u2019t need the approval of a cap and gown. He is grinding to make the money he deserves no matter what people say. You know how the saying goes He\u2019s going to destroy 100 more rappers and surpass them: taking their spots.\n\nMGK Eating! A reference to the mixtape and this song is. It\u2019s a way of describing his endless flow; he can spit a hundred words and keep going. Double Entendre\n1 He\u2019s saying he has been working so hard, or hustling in the rap game for so long he has to get noticed sometime soon.\n\n2 He\u2019s been fucking these haters/hoes for so long he has to blow (as in load) soon (Referring to the previous line with haters on his scrotum)\n\nGrinding, popularized by The Clipse is slang for hustling\n\n Blow is short for \u201cblowing up\u201d, slang for getting big or achieving a level of success. Hes from the eastside of Cleveland and he carries EST till he dies no matter how much fame he\u2019s gain. A metaphor for destroying other artists. He \u201cpassed\u201d 100 rappers cause he\u2019s better than them all and he\u2019s still better. He\u2019s saying \u201cno\u201d to the people who didn\u2019t befriend him before before he got big. She keeps calling him probably for child support  but he\u2019s not dealing with any baby mama drama. The Shit=ALL THAT. He plays on flatulence, another thing that comes out your ass and stinks. He uses gassin' as a slang term for hyping up.\n\nKells is so sick he makes other people ill! The line with the sick dog is a pun; bitch = female dog, bitch = woman. He is shouting out his fans that have been with him from the very beginning. Kell\u2019s nickname is The Kid in Cleveland, but at the same time he\u2019s the known for his being one of the coolest cats around. People who dont like MGK will say, \u201cWhy do you listen to this guy?\u201d Probably because of songs like Wild Boy, one of his less lyrical songs compared to others. He can\u2019t be messed with. He\u2019s giving the phrase \u201con my dick\u201d or \u201cjocking\u201d his own twist. This idiomatic slang means they\u2019re annoying him and scrotum pertains to ball sack (for those of you who don\u2019t know).\n\n\u201cBack then hoes didn\u2019t want me, now I\u2019m hot hoes all on me\u201d\n\nThis is typical of the rise to fame for an artist, people who didn\u2019t like them or discredited their verbal grind, have chaged their minds due to success. A lot of famous rappers forget to keep it real once they get famous. But not him, hes still hustling and staying true. He\u2019s not trying to impress anybody. By remembering his name, it\u2019s a tribute to where he came from.\n\nKells is also referencing the song beat that he used \u201cRemember the Name\u201d by Fort Minor He is second to no one in Cleveland, fuck being the prince, Kells is Cleveland\u2019s king because no one can grind like he does for his city. Reference to classes in school; Kells \u2018schools\u2019 (beats; shows what\u2019s up) to anyone who tries to beat him in the rap game. Kells and his EST boys grinded their way to the top by themselves, and don\u2019t owe anybody anything for getting famous, that was all them. No matter what Machine Gun Kelly is the new king of the rap game, even if you accept or not.\n\n\n\nOr as Joe Budden has said it on BET Shady 2.0 Cypher:\n\nI\u2019m grown i aint watching the throne im sabotaging it People praise lil wayne cause they think he goes hard when in reality he doesn\u2019t. He\u2019s claiming to go harder than him. He\u2019s promising to not only smoke a blunt with all of his followers, but to personally prepare the blunt beforehand\n\nTHAT is how real he is A constellation is a group of stars that are connected in groups in the night sky. When a fridge is turned off the coolness starts to decrease. He\u2019s comparing this to how other rappers are \u201cuncool\u201d. A machine gun is a highly powered automatic weapon and pistols can\u2019t match up with them in most cases. It\u2019s also metaphorical for how fast he raps. Usually when a King dies if they have a son, he will take his position of royalty.\n\n\n\nSidenote: He may possibly denouncing his father for casting him out to live on his own. Evidently making him the man of his own household. Kamikazes are Japanese military aviators strapped with C4 who sacrifice themselves for a cause.\n\n\n\nHe\u2019s cocky (confident) because he knows no one can top him and if they were to try, it would be like committing suicide Steelo is another word for style or ego. Throughout various points on the mixtape:\n\nFuck them, pay me\n\nHe realizes in order to survive he needs money for a lot of things. For his events and as well as for rhymes.

Often after a rapper gets signed by a record label their style of rapping changes as a result of conforming to the mainstream. They\u2019re not as hardcore because they don\u2019t have to push as hard as they did before with their music because they achieved their goal (to become famous).\n\nThe industry wants you to sound your life away.

He\u2019s hot a lot of money, so the price of anything he wants to get doesn\u2019t concern him. Posing a rhetorical question. A white flag symbolizes surrender, meaning he\u2019s never going to give up or form a truce with anyone or anything he\u2019s at war with. You\u2019re not figuring him out as well as his thoughts are complicated. Kells is going crazy. He\u2019s as mental (crazy) as Sigmund Freud an Austrian Neurologist who founded the discipline of Psychoanalysis The bottom of the totem pole is and idiom and imagery for being unimportant or ignored, unlike someone or something at is at the top.\n\nKells knows he\u2019s a young rapper on the rise, and if you didn\u2019t believe him before here\u2019s the chance better believe it now. he knew he would get big eventually and everyone that doubt he has something to say to them.\n\nI Told You Hoes Saying that he\u2019s Cleveland\u2019s Lebron James of Hip-Hop.

It\u2019s about a man who cheated and now feels sorry after being caught.\n\nJason DeRulo told Digital Spy how this song came about:\n\nBasically my brother called me one day and said, \u2018I cheated on my girl, but I love her so much and I hope she\u2019ll give me one more shot\u2019. I found his story really compelling, so I just went into the studio and tried it out.\n\n\u201cWhatcha Say\u201d became a huge success in late 2009, reaching the top of the Billboard charts on November 14.\n\n(Fun Fact: This song was was originally written for Sean Kingston.)\n\nProduction-wise, \u201cWhatcha Say\u201d heavily samples Imogen Heap\u2019s \u201cHide and Seek\u201d. Find out more about the production here. He just feel so bad for what he did, that is very hard to even live with himself. He just let the the bad get the better of him and now he is ashamed for losing the one thing he REALLY loved. When his girlfriend discovered that he was cheating, he didn\u2019t know what too do. But he has big dreams and plans for them in the future, and he realized that she is the girl for him. He wants to make up with her. When his girlfriend discovered that he was cheating, he didn\u2019t know what too do.  But he has big dreams and plans for them in the future, and he realized that she is the girl for him.  He wants to make up with her. Although the verses are all from the POV of a cheating boyfriend, the chorus (sampled from Imogen Heap\u2019s \u201cHide And Seek\u201d) serves as a response to those verses.\n\nAnd in case you didn\u2019t realize, it\u2019s totally sarcastic.\n\nClearly, him cheating on someone behind your back then saying it\u2019s for the best and that he only meant well is not true\u2026at all. Although the song is in a first-person narrative, it\u2019s actually inspired by Derulo\u2019s brother, not Derulo himself.\n\nRegardless, the narrator was in a relationship, but only did it for himself, not for his girlfriend. So he cheated on her!\n\nHowever, he claims he was only caught up in this other girl\u2019s lust, and he just wants to date the person he\u2019s actually dating, because they\u2019re supposed to be together forever and never give each other up. But he just needs another chance!\n\nSure, it\u2019s a logical fallacy due to an emotional appeal, but Derulo never made a follow-up song or said what came of his brother, so we can only imagine\u2026 Producer J. R. Rotem heavily sampled Imogen Heap\u2019s \u201cHide and Seek\u201d\u2026 particularly the bridge.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/UYIAfiVGluk?t=172\n\nJason DeRulo gave the backstory behind the usage of the song:\n\n[\u2026] One day I picked up Imogen Heap, brought it into JR and we both loved it, so we started to experiment. It just so happened that my brother had just been telling me his story [about cheating on his girlfriend].\n\n(The woman has a sarcastic tone in this hook, just like it was when Imogen Heap sang it in \u201cHide and Seek\u201d.) the girl promised to always be by his side no matter what and he cheated and saying remember what did you you said you will always be here for me when he was caught he knew that he couldn\u2019t lie, that he would have to tell the truth he didn\u2019t know how to handle it but he\u2019s telling her that when he becomes famous and has millions they\u2019ll be living the life and she can have all she\u2019s ever wanted he\u2019s begging her to stay even though she caught him cheating he loves her and want to make it right he\u2019s saying that all he needs is one chance to prove to her that he really is sorry and that it won\u2019t happen again and he knows it was stupid but that he knows that they are meant for each other "},{"album": {"api_path": "/albums/253", "name": "Daylight EP", "artist": {"url": "http://genius.com/artists/Aesop-rock", "is_verified": false, "image_url": "https://images.rapgenius.com/0319654b1765c879536c8bb589849202.650x484x1.jpg", "id": 178, "name": "Aesop Rock"}, "url": "http://genius.com/albums/Aesop-rock/Daylight-ep", "cover_art_url": "https://images.rapgenius.com/1beb2c0b79414f10a2104f948ad4494c.800x800x1.jpg", "id": 253}, "song_id": 6029, "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 11, "transcribers": 0, "contributors": 32, "iq_earners": 32, "accepted_annotations": 40, "hot": false, "pageviews": 11901, "verified_annotations": 0}, "artist": {"url": "http://genius.com/artists/Aesop-rock", "is_verified": false, "image_url": "https://images.rapgenius.com/0319654b1765c879536c8bb589849202.650x484x1.jpg", "id": 178, "name": "Aesop Rock"}, "pyongs_count": null, "title": "One Of Four (Thank You)", "annotations": "This song was written as thank you, and apology, to the four people who mattered most to Aesop Rock\u2019s career in putting him on after he suffered a nervous breakdown that caused him to quit his first United States tour. *drain Aesop wouldn\u2019t describe himself a person that can do many different types of work but is not necessarily very competent at any of them. He only likes to do one thing which is write songs and he\u2019s not sure if they\u2019re any good. Aesop is thanking the four people that saved his life in the only way he knew how through writing a song. The Four soldiers represent Jamie (El-p), Raia, Kathryn, and Tony. Each of them did it,according to Aesop, out of kindness and that is something Aesop will forever hold sacred.\n\nEven though its the only way Aesop can think to thank them, he still feels like its not enough and wishes he could give them something more. They gave him something so pure and Aesop feels he like he cant reciprocate that action. Never in his life had Aesop faced a situation like the one he encountered during those few months and without these four people he wouldn\u2019t of survived it. The monster represents the nervous breakdown he suffered in 2001, when he would stay in his Brooklyn apartment for days on end just chain smoking cigs and being scared to leave.\nHere\u2019s an article on Aesop about how he was during the time depicted in this song Ian Mathias Bavitz is Aesop Rock\u2019s real name and he was born in Long island, New York. He is announcing himself to his audience to give the song a more personal touch, and to tell the world how these four people saved his life. meds beyond limits* As in she was concerned much more than Aes could have expected any other person to be for him. This line refers the nervous breakdown he had which forced him shut down his first U.S. tour, Revenge of the Robots. The event was traumatic, and very easily could have brought his career to a halt.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtXigYAMfvk\nThe whole song is basically a thanks to the people that stuck with him despite what happened. Knowing you\u2019re not alone can be helpful in coping with a mental illness or any disease in general. Developing a support network is essential to deal with a major obstacle or problem in one\u2019s life. He feels that he has lost everything but his word. Which here can have a double meaning because he is referring to his reliability on promises he makes, but also, nothing can ever take his word, which can refer to his work as a rap artist. His soul has gone tilt. When a pinball machine goes tilt, all of the machinery inside shuts down, and the there is nothing that can be done to correct the situation until the ball rolls into the drain. Furthermore he\u2019s got a pocket full of pennies, useless for a standard pinball machine which would only take quarters. This line underscores a feeling of hopelessness. Aesop would catch a bullet for El-P.\nEl-P later responded to this hearty notion on the inside sleeve of the FanDam LP, stating\n\nfor Aesop who I would take a bullet for too, although he would never ask me to Mental illness can make you feel like you\u2019re bordering on the insane. slight revision:  \u201cthrough medicated mileage.\u201d meaning traveling through this part of his life self-medicated to be able to make it. Tony made Aes laugh when he felt so down, he might as well be dead. When a fish dies it floats in the water upside down or with it\u2019s \u201cbelly up.\u201d If you\u2019re surrounded with good people, like the four in this song, then you don\u2019t have to worry about your weaknesses since they\u2019re there to help you. The four people in this song don\u2019t think that Aesop Rock owes them anything especially his life but he wants them to know if it wasn\u2019t for them he may have kill himself, overdosed on drugs, etc. Aesop Rock knows what he wants to say to these four people but he has trouble turning his thoughts into words. His songs are also hard to understand since he uses a lot of metaphor, more than any other rapper probably. He\u2019s saying it\u2019s ironic that he was under the same amount of pressure and stress regular workers are, but he ended up breaking down when other people haven\u2019t. He\u2019s thought about what happened over and over, until he couldn\u2019t come up with any conclusions He\u2019s thanking his friends for what they did in helping him out of his nervous breakdown, killing the bad thoughts he had or \u2018what made a mess of him\u2019 Aesop is apologising for the hassle he caused his friends and the toll he had taken on their social life His feelings of guilt and self-loathing came from a period in his life he never fully emotionally found closure in. this song isn\u2019t one to be bumped from a car stereo; it\u2019s not that kind of song He still doesn\u2019t know how or why he had his breakdown. Pistons are engine parts.  If the pistons don\u2019t work, a car can do nothing; the engine can\u2019t run.  If Aes\u2019s brain were an engine, something inside is broken at a crucial level. Psychiatrists, \u201cshrinks,\u201d did nothing to help him.  \u201cAwkward silence\u201d means despite charging $250 an hour, he and a shrink sat in silence and accomplished nothing. The out-dated, \u201ccave-man\u201d cures did nothing to cure his affliction. He used old, primitive methods of curing his issue.  Self taught likely means he was self-medicating Hes Saying that without 1 of the 4 people who picked him up he would still be lost.  It was a combined effort and without one of the people he mentions later in the song he would still be lost. He starts feeling the physical effects of his breakdown: dizziness, nausea, unable to use his motor functions properly. His main items of purchase He tried to keep it on the down low, but could barely make it to the nearby store and back. Aesop Rock\u2019s first album where he first stepped onto the scene with his baritone voice and abstract lyrics music for the underground, this song ain\u2019t. Biz 3, the PR firm founded by Kathryn Frazier that represents Aesop Rock, is based out of Chicago. He hopes to explain brief message of thanks to all those who helped him through such difficult times. He basically means he could never repay them for what they\u2019ve done for him. Someone who is Agoraphobic is literally the fear of \u2018the market\" and more likely someone who is a afraid of open spaces like a public place.  Aesop Rock creates the word \u201cGorophobe\u201d to mean the opposite.  He has a fear of small spaces (like a tunnel) and can only see what\u2019s in front of him. Shook his whole being and frighten him to death like the friendly ghost. In this intro, it reveals these personal details about him:\n\n\nAesop\u2019s real name\nDate of birth, place of birth\nHeight and weight\nHair and eye color\nThings he enjoys, which ultimately make him an artist\nThe names of his siblings\nThe names of his parents\n\n\n\nUp until this song Aes had never gotten personal in a song. This intro fits with the theme as he is finally telling people about himself.

Aesop Rock\u2019s first big tour in America, \u201cWho Killed the Robots?\u201d, intended to promote him as a rapper (along with a couple others) and his first album, \u201cLabor Days\u201d.

Multiple types have evolved over time because various applications tend to favor one form or the other.  For instance, professional custom painters that are commonly painting candy on cars and motorcycles where the candy is the predominate color feature typically prefer the 2K urethane candy to achieve maximum depth and durability.  However, graphic artist using candy as part of their graphic scheme often prefer candy basecoat as it dries faster, is less sensitive to recoat, gives a cleaner tape line and does not require activator so there is no immediate concern for pot life.  Painters first learning to use candy paints will sometimes use a candy basecoat as well, reporting that it is easier to apply evenly.  Candy concentrates are a great tool often used by professionals in combination with urethane clear or intercoat clear to create custom candy colors and effects. cf.

Only problem is the fight was in 1964 so Yasiin got the year wrong. You can\u2019t prosper or enjoy anything in life without believing in it, or believing in oneself.\n\nBelieving in his talents is what got Mos to where he is today, so he follows this philosophy faithfully Huge part of MCing and rhyming is one\u2019s voice flowing and molding itself into the rhythm of the beat Question in your mind the purpose and heart of\u2026 Love is the spirit that drives Mos and has guided him throughout his life, to where he is now. His love for MCing kept him out of crime, and it allowed him to pursue his passions Check it.. \u201cSpent my early years in\u201d as in\u2026he grew up in, the Roosevelt Projects in Brooklyn Should Mos just acknowledge that he wrote some meaningful things and move on? Should Mos abandon his rhymes and then return there later in life just to relive the \u201cglory days\u201d? Or will he craft songs and monuments out of his thoughts and ideologies? His father had sex raw in order to have him (raw deal) He is natural and a creation; just as elements in the periodic table are; and he is an obvious sign of love as he was made from it into a human. So now he can breathe and create love throughout his own life Rap Attack was the first rap radio show to air on a major radio station. It premiered in 1981 on WHBI-FM and was hosted by Mr. Magic. This chorus is a reference to \u201cI Know You Got Soul\u201d by Eric B and Rakim Vendy C a radio host in 1983 The Roosevelt Projects were enjoyable enough to Mos, but like all projects, it had many negative aspects too. (probably drug dealings, killings, rape, etc) the start of Mos Def\u2019s religious imagery, where nonbelievers become one with the earth when they die whereas those who believe will be enlightened, leading to his godlike M.C. proclamation of \u201csoftening\u201d nonbelievers (through hip hop) Yasiin Bey is a muslim. He wasn\u2019t exposed to Islam until his age of 13, though. Six years later he expressed his shahada, the Muslim declaration of faith. With this line, Yasiin Bey(Mos Def) manifests what most of the music artists feel while writing a song. Like any other form of art, writing is way to canalize your feelings. What you write can represent your strongest emotions. A throw back to older Hip Hop, where these type of breaks would be used all the time for people to dance too. Common expands on it here. Sometimes if kids are raised and spoiled too much by there parents, when they get older they get hit by the pain of the real world hard. We endure the hardships of our lives today, in the faith that one day they\u2019ll pay off and we\u2019ll be rewarded with prosperity and longevity. When he\u2019s writing poems and songs, he might use metaphors or wordplay, but if you read between the lines, you see what he actually means.\n\nKinda reminds me of RapGenius. He writes poetry and songs about things that he often think about. Universal Magnetic was Mos Def\u2019s first single. It\u2019s safe to assume that, like A Tribe Called Quest, Mos Def usually listened to music at night. His life\u2019s a testament to the love his parents had for each other. Earlier in the line he states his birth date: his parents were together when they had him and afterwards.  Maybe the only reason you can\u2019t see it is because you have to use your other senses because your eyes can deceive you. like the sun lights the earth and gives it warmth, Mos Def wants to enlighten us to make us wiser. The most definitely, also \u201cF-initely\u201d sounds like \u201cinfinitely\u201d, which links to the several times repeated line \u201cbuilding the now for the promise of the infinite\u201d. He\u2019s reaching for the stars, though people said he couldn\u2019t. He tries to write about the feeling/\u201cvibe\u201d of wonder inside the \u201cspace\u201d \u2013 his mind, brain (visualize it!) \u2013 when you \u201cclose your eyes and screw your face\u201d It was love that kept Mos motivated and able to stay out with the crew or his family or a special someone. Mos believes his pop, the words were \u201csincere\u201d. He really meant what he said, \u201ccharged with emotion\u201d, and he understands what his pop said, because it was love. Mutual love, understanding and respect. Mos wasn\u2019t exactly an accident; his dad made him from making love. Mos' love for writing rhymes kept him in the house where he could focus on perfecting his art, rather than involving himself in gang activity. Rap nowadays is all about posturing and showing off material objects Theoretically, Mos' child is about to arrive. \u2018Son\u2019 bursts through the clouds, and looks exactly like Mos. Mos has passed down the love instilled in him by his parents from the point of his creation to you the listener through his music. Mos spends the first verse of the song reflecting on his past. This line builds a bridge to the second verse in which Mos speaks about his future.\n\nThroughout the song, Mos alludes to his relation with an everlasting spirit.  This spirit has taken the form of hip-hop and Mos has responded the only way he knows how: with love. By 1963, Muhammad Ali had established himself as a boxing phenom with a 19-0 record and 15 K.O.\u2019s. Neighborhoods within the boroughs of New York City. Fort Greene is in Brooklyn.  Uptown refers to Uptown Manhattan.  Boogie is the Bronx. The Arabic word for \u201camen.\u201d  It is said after prayers in affirmation. James Brown\u2019s \u201cFunky Drummer\u201d is the most-sampled song in hip-hop history.  This is due to its infectious drum break.\n\nHe flips the title by suggestively transforming the drummer into a plowman, beating the earth with his drumsticks as with a hoe, cultivating land, which continues the growth/agriculture metaphor from above. Mos delves into the metaphor of an MC as a farmhand. Rapping too involves physical strain. M.C. usually stands for \u201cmaster of ceremony,\u201d or at least \u201cMove the Crowd.\u201d Mos aspires to make transcendent music.  That which cultivates will  encourage growth, i.e. evolved music, in the future.\n\n*Notice the initials of \u201cI must cultivate\u201d: I.M.C. The you he is addressing are materialistic people who strive for the transient goal of accumulating wealth. Mos Def, and likeminded individuals, are concerned far more with the ancient past and infinite future and the present. Before calculators were invented, people used abaci to count Portmanteau of Mos Def\u2019s hip-hop duo Black Star and prolific sci-fi TV series\u2026nerd! Mos Def has chosen to build landmarks \u2013 make his own classic songs for fans to revere Phrase commonly uttered by old school rappers.  Its use continues the theme of Mos Def\u2019s love for early hip-hop.

Rap Attack, one of the first hip-hop radio shows, gets particular love from Brooklyn MCs Roosevelt Houses are a public housing project in Brooklyn, named after Eleanor Roosevelt. Allah Mos Def\u2019s born day: December 11, 1973. This hook is taken directly from \u201cI Know You Got Soul\u201d Eric B. & Rakim.

Forget the rapping and the music that talks about his success, look at his roots and life in Georgia. Examine his past not his future. He\u2019s already dead and the game is dying with him? The end of time is near. Last chapter of the Bible or the end of  humanity is right around the corner. KKK still exists. Thats how you know.

He trying to find the answers to the problems he has Its hard to live life to the fullest so he trying to live the life that was given to him Bendin' Corners is to be walking around looking for something to do. Andre is saying be careful for what your looking for. Going back to the previous lines, remember what he said, after he\u2019s gone pay your respects. Rappers who \u201ccame out the gutta\u201d are usually rapping about the flashy things they have now. While Andre 3000 is dropping knowledge, things that wont dumb you down. The aforementioned crooks are the ones who use state benefits to support themselves. This could be referring to other rappers whose lyrics aren\u2019t meant to be intelligent or thought provoking He is referencing the racial issues that he feels still exist in our country, claiming that the only thing that is free is his flow (and not black people) Andr\u00e9 Lauren Benjamin (Andre 3000) was born on May 27, 1975.

It means that everything is going well.; life is carefree. Books teach things and give knowledge. He\u2019s saying that he speaks knowledge to people. So dropping knowledge = dropping books.

You have my word, I will not fail, Through thick & thin. I will prevail when it\u2019s all said & done. To \u201cshow someone the ropes\u201d is to teach them how to do something. For example a new person is hired at your job \u2013 if your boss tells you to \u201cshow her the ropes\u201d he is asking you to help take her around and teach her how things work.\n\nOriginally this idiom meant literal ropes on a ship, when a new guy showed up a sailor would \u201cshow them\u201d how to work the \u201cropes\u201d of the sail. Aesop is taking this in a different direction \u2013 the ropes in a boxing ring.\n\nHe\u2019s saying he has been given the responsibility to show the new kids \u201cthe ropes\u201d even though he\u2019s never been in the ring (\u201cI dodged the ring\u201d) in the first place.\n\nIt\u2019s a metaphor for saying he\u2019s been given a role he isn\u2019t sufficiently qualified for. Cogito ergo sum (I think, therefore I am), whatever you perceive yourself to be you will ultimately become it, wither it be good or bad (in this case it\u2019s bad). MORAL OF THE STORY: Never sell yourself short, You are greater than the negative things you may think about yourself, You are greater than other peoples' negative opinions about you. In the end they are all lies. He (Aesop Rock) finally understood the mysterious way of God [1 Corinthians 4:1], He stopped trusting in his limited understanding and finally gave in to the unlimited wisdom that is Yahweh [Proverbs 3:5-6]. Why me?! Why? Out of all people, Why did I go to Heaven?! I don\u2019t get it! I mean, I\u2019m a scumbag low-life for Christ sakes! Why take pity on me?! Why take me?!! Still\u2026 there is an unanswered question that has been bothering him from the start. He is done with all this. He is finished, like Jesus the Christ said in the Bible [John 19:28]. He has decided that he isn\u2019t playing by God\u2019s rules anymore because he is tired of obeying him and singing his hymns and songs. He\u2019s from the wrong side of the tracks like Artifacts. He is asking: How am I supposed to do something that I was never involved in? I never went to church! I never read the Bible or the Qu'ran a day in my life! I was a lawless criminal! What do you want from me?! What do you expect?!! Now he is expected to be a guardian angel. Bringing people out the dark side of the force like Luke Skywalker (pictured). He tries to think back to all the things he did while he was still on Earth and wonders why he ended up in place such as this? It just doesn\u2019t make sense to him. In other words: I don\u2019t think this life is for me. Through all his trying to cope with the fact of life after death, Aesop Rock still manages to fuck something up. Continuing on why he doesn\u2019t deserve this role: His legacy isn\u2019t one of prestige and shouldn\u2019t be a model for anyone. He\u2019s hardly a saint. This is continuing the theme that he isn\u2019t worthy of the role he has been given. This is personified by the image of an angel. He\u2019s saying he doesn\u2019t deserve to be held in such high regard because he does not or can not fit in. He doesn\u2019t see this afterlife as rewarding at all. It is all a burden and inconvenience to him. He says that he died too soon, He isn\u2019t ready for all this yet. Instead of Feet through greet and lowlife virus, I think he is saying: \u201csee-through cretin lowlife virus\u201d, Meaning that if God refuses to murder / banish him then he hopes he gets painfully sick & die however the possibility of this happening to him during the afterlife is slim to none. He just wanted to be like everyone else, he wanted to be \u201cnormal\u201d (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normality_%28behavior%29). This line is a Non-sequitur (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non_sequitur_%28logic%29). I guess what he is trying to say is: I never wanted to achieve greatness or be something spectacular. Just as the lyric states above: He didn\u2019t agree to be involved in this holy fellowship. CORRECTION: Man, there wasn\u2019t no arrangement\n\nTRANSLATION: I didn\u2019t agree to take part in this. He is like 2Pac Shakur (http://genius.com/178532/2pac-ghetto-gospel/I-refuse-to-be-a-role-model). I have good qualities and bad qualities like every other man, however, the bad outweighs the good, and I don\u2019t care about the qualities I could or should have. I was seen as scum, a lowlife, and I was. So I never felt like I deserved anything good. He wants the silencer to shoot him between the eyes, thereby ending his life before he even knows what happened. Aesop wants to die but he doesn\u2019t want to feel pain (dormant) and he wants to die execution-style with a silencer (pictured). Translation: If it means that I die again, where I become nothingness or be thrown into purgatory, then I don\u2019t care, so be it. Just make it quick, I don\u2019t want wait any longer than I have to. Aes says he doesn\u2019t feel equal in the presence of God & angels, therefore, he feels asymmetric (unequal) and can\u2019t handle the circumstances he is in right now. He is asking God to separate himself from him, He is asking: \u201cJust let me die, Let me rot in the ground\u201d. Aesop Rock is saying that while God\u2019s offering of eternal life is great (final extension), he feels he isn\u2019t worthy of such a thing. The man says that he regrets his ramblings and finally admits who he is: The Great I AM (God, Yahweh). The man is trying to explain what he is. He is saying that he is everywhere (possibly Omnipotent?) The Bible states in Exodus 3:14 that God said: \u201cI AM WHO I AM\u201d and \u201cI WILL BE WHAT I WILL BE\u201d. TRANSLATION: Taken from the Bible [Romans 3:23] \u2013 \u201c\u2026for all have sinned and come short of the glory of God\u201d I was saved somehow, a man said he could save me from damnation. CORRECTION: Ringin' his chime.\n\nA possible reference to England poet John Donne (pictured) and his elegy (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elegy), Meditation XVII when he states: \u201cany mans death diminishes me, because I am involved in Mankinde; And therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls; It tolls for thee..\u201d My fate wasn\u2019t an easy one, It was sloppy like a drunk. I have seen angels like my self die, while I have been the one to carry their remains in a Radio Flyer wagon (pictured) to bury them.

In August 2005, Suge was shot in the leg outside of a Kanye West Video Music Awards party.\n\nMany people speculate that Suge was involved in the murder of Tupac Shakur and Game feels that Knight getting shot was a bit of Karma coming back to him. Shawn Carter took on the stage name of Jay-Z once he began pursuing a career in music. The word boosie is actually BOUGIE. Stating that Jay was stuck up compared to other people from Brooklyn and that his attitude wasn\u2019t that of a typical Broolkynite. The Game knew not to fuck with Suge Knight. He probably should have flipped these lines, because you do dumb stuff in college. Backwards it doesn\u2019t make as much sense. Suge knight is no stranger to be locked ups (taken from MikeMorg from his annotation on 2pac track \u201cskandolouz\u201d because there is no need to change it) Scandolous shit is referring to 2-pacs' song \u201cskandolouz\u201d In this track, Pac is mostly talking about scandalous women (suge is a bitch, my wording). The type to dissemble, play you, take your money. An obvious shot at suge knight. Maybe referring to Kurupt resigning to Deathrow Records in the early 2000\u2019s. From 1983 to 1985, he attended El Camino College on a football scholarship. Jay-Z has been very open on his past of hustling in Marcy Projects That gangster being The Game.

Jay-Z also penned a song titled \u201cDear Summer\u201d in which he farewells summer as this is typically when his singles were released.

Nick Broomfield\u2019s documentary Biggie and Tupac features people (including ex-police officers) claiming that Suge ordered the murders of both artists. Wordplay on Jay-Z\u2019s former best friend Dame Dash in which they had a fallout. Jay-Z was featured in the video of Jaz-O\u2019s Hawaiian Sophie wearing a hawaiian shirt and sporting a flattop hairstyle Wordplay on the word 50 Cent.. Half a dollar also means 50 cent .. In other words, 50 is so desperate to earn money that he will even perform for a show for half a dollar 50 is from South Jamaica of Queens. Game is sayin 50 grew up giving head to brothers for cash.

The less impressive artists step aside when Linkin Park enters the room. They part like the Red Sea. Mike is here using a metaphor to say he\u2019ll help them to see the truth, and he will let the light into their eyes so they see the problems and reality of things going on in front of their eyes.\n\nAlso most likely a reference to Matthew 9:27-31 where Jesus heals two blind men. 9/11 Mike (like a lot of other people) calls bullshit on the argument that the \u201cWar On Terror\u201d is to make the world safe, and argues that the wars are being fought only to make the elite of the world more wealthy and powerful. Mike is referring to the criticism people received that were against the so-called \u201cWar On Terror\u201d in the beginning. He is talking about propaganda and how America is being bombarded with this due to the Bush Patriot Act. Mike speaks from a prospective of small kid from Iraq or Afghanistan, thinking about how another boy his age is killed during the war and wandering if he is going to die or when he is going to die. Politics have become entertainment, especially for those who feel they aren\u2019t affected by it.\n\nThis refers to the previous lines, emphasizing the point that the public doesn\u2019t live in fear or danger. They\u2019re just \u201cin the living room\u201d criticizing the stutters and mumbles of leaders with the lives of billions resting on making good decisions. Being obscenely wealthy makes you completely oblivious to the trials the vast majority of the population go through. This is the first song where Mike provides the vocals on his own. While you can\u2019t even get the money to fill up your car with gas due to the high prices, the people in charge still want you to praise and respect them, even though in reality they don\u2019t give a fuck about you.  They just want your money (laughing their way to the bank and cashing their checks). Become a real voice and fight for the truth instead of what \u201cthey (the rulers of the world) say is right.\u201d This is a reference back to the last 4 bars of the first verse, and in the first verse it was from an American point of view and this is from his Iraqi/Afghanistani (the specific country is never specified but we can assume it is one of those 2 countries at war with America) perspective. the only difference between the 2 verses' use of these 4 bars is one word in the last line, in the first verse it says Americans are in the living room laughing, because to them no matter how bad the war gets, an American citizen doesn\u2019t have to worry about being a random casualty just walking outside of their house. In the 2nd verse from the other perspective, it says they\u2019re both scared and angry, because they know that whatever mistake Bush makes could very well mean their lives are in even more jeopardy than they were the day before. He sees the American soldiers out brushing away the dust from bulletproof vests, while he is watching kids his own age dying in that very dust who were just innocent casualties, whereas the soldiers are out prepared for violence with their bulletproof vests The bold men are who we call terrorists, but he is saying they\u2019re simply men who \u201cHave to react\u201d to save themselves and their country from getting \u201cblown into fractions\u201d by the American insurgency. the first verse was from the perspective of the average annoyed American, and now he has made a transition and is speaking from the point of view of a 10 year old boy in Iraq or Afghanistan, who has to actually live with the life and death situations of the war we\u2019ve waged. Americans are just \u201cin the living room laughing\u201d but he is in his living room watching and terrified of what the speech might mean for his own safety. What\u2019s ours is our freedoms taken away by the Bush Patriot Act, so he\u2019s saying it\u2019s time for us to risk something and fight to get our right\u2019s back We\u2019ve turned into slaves, when \u201cthey\u201d tell us to jump, we follow orders Usually, if u give up, or when a cop arrests u, u put ur hands up high where they can see them. This probably means that some soldiers gave up on war, and came out with their hands held high. There are bombs everywhere.Mike knows that his dad is afraid of that bombs and he doesn\u2019t show. We pray to \u201cGod\u201d to solve the war crisis but religious organizations aside from our own are undergoing terrorism. This quote is from French philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre, whose quotations are widely known amongst people who consider themselves Socialist. Most likely the famous Chinese government work \u201cQuotations from Chairman Mao\u201d which was more commonly just called \u2018The Little Red Book.\u2019 Mike Shinoda is suggesting that George W. Bush is not competent enough to speak for himself. This is referencing past experiences when he has been caught messing up his speech.\n\nThese and the next lines state that the media scrutinizes the one in power, and laughs when their leader shows weakness.

Still flaunting her expensive tastes (and affinity for French style), Mia asks her beau to get her home furnishings in the Louis XIV-style.  See plenty of examples here N.O. at the time had quite a few housing projects throughout the city, numbering about a dozen total See here for info on the neighborhood of Hollygrove (home of Weezy!) By \u201cBunny and Mice\u201d, Mia presumably means not the animals, but some friends of hers with bizarre nicknames.

As the world\u2019s most reliable encyclopedia explains, the term \u201cWest Bank\u201d has a particular meaning in metro N.O.:\n\nIn the New Orleans metropolitan area, the term \u201cEast Bank\u201d is a blanket term used to refer to all portions of metropolitan New Orleans south of Lake Pontchartrain and situated on the \u201ceastern\u201d bank of the river, while the term \u201cWest Bank\u201d is used to refer to all portions of metropolitan New Orleans south of Lake Pontchartrain and situated on the \u201cwestern\u201d bank of the river Mia wants her man to buy her designer clothes:\n\nNo stuff from Polo Ralph Lauren, thanks \u2013 guess she\u2019s not a Lo-Life\n\nDespite their overwhelming popularity in New Orleans (including regular shout-outs from Juvenile), Mia does not want stuff from Marithe Francois Girbaud, but rather from DKNY (Donna Karan New York)\n\nAnd for tennis shoes, she does not want K-Swiss \u2013 not surprising, considering what she\u2019d have to do to get them.  Instead, she wants stuff from the more upscale Anne Klein We agree!  See our blog post on this same topic Mia is not a cheap date!

Hear an example in Lil Slim\u2019s 1993 song \u201cBounce Slide Ride\u201d This stanza is to the tune of the nursery rhyme \u201cThis Old Man\u201d Mia responds to a bounce chant originally popularized by DJ Jimi on his cover of \u201cWhere They At\u201d.

The Pharaoh of Egypt frees the Israelites after his people start dying. Moses is elected by God to lead them out of Egypt. There\u2019s a double meaning with \u2018biting\u2019:\n\n\nRappers don\u2019t even think about biting his rhymes\nGarden of Eden \u2013 \u201cat \u2018em\u201d sounds similar to Adam \u2014 who was tricked by Eve into biting the apple, which God had forbid. Ever since the beginning of time binary stars been perfecting there lyrics. When its time to fight all his friends get together to handle the problem. There rap style is quick. Referring to the story of David and Goliath. Binary Star is the underdog that eventually cuts of the head of the non-believers. This story is mentioned in their song Indy 500 as well. Ending the song by reminding you who they are: they\u2019re Binary Stars, and the only way you\u2019re going to see them in the sky/understand the complexity of their rhymes, is if you\u2019re an astrologist, son. The obvious other interpretation being \u201creign\u201d. Cats and dogs/doggs/dawgs might talk shit to Binary Star, but their threats are meaningless. Rock/rubble. Quite simple. Ending a pristine verse with a clever reference to Adam and Eve in the garden of Eden. They couldn\u2019t hide their modesty and you can hide your bullshit-ass rhymes. Obviously punning on the word \u201crap\u201d, but also continuing the religious metaphors. John the Baptist was, of course, beheaded in the Bible. At once talking about those who try to trace his rap technique getting lost in its intricacy, and also continuing the reference to Moses, who parted- and then closed- the ocean. This whole verse is filled with connected biblical imagery. Major-league alliteration and assonance here. Extended metaphor to do with cars and crashing/being defeated in a rap battle. Extends all the way to \u201cguard your fender\u201d a couple of lines down. Continuing the wind metaphor. No homo. Waterworld is the nickname of Michigan, where Binary Star are from, and also the title of their first album. Not only is he physically abusing you with his quick witty (whip like) lyricism that you cant escape from because he is your master (you are a slave to his music) but he is the master of Natural Disaster aka God aka The Master of the Universe (On the song Masters of the Universe on the album of the same title) Punning on \u201cCain and Abel\u201d, biblical brothers who betrayed each other, is a favourite passtime of One Be Lo in particular. Throughout the whole song, One Be Lo and Senim Silla are trading off lines extremely rapidly, sometimes switching between one another multiple times in a single sentence. Hence the emphasis on their unity of being in the opening lines. \u201cThe two-headed dragon\u201d is a vivid metaphor for Binary Star themselves; \u201csame brain\u201d emphasises how tight their rapping is, and the fire imagery is just bangin'.\n\nThe \u2018same brain\u2019 and two-headed dragon metaphor is furthered by the fact that they\u2019re trading off lines on the verse like it\u2019s just one emcee with one brain spittin'.

Furthermore, you were trying to cheat too, not just your girl, so don\u2019t be a hypocrite! You might even have been pushing her away with your behaviour.\n\nDon\u2019t try and be a Luke Skywalker\u2026 (the Forces!) Here, Skinner has his didactic hat firmly on and is encouraging the listener, if ever in a similar situation, to not react in the predictable, dysfunctional way, but to use the \u201cchoices\u201d and exit the situation sensibly \u2013 i.e. without needless violence. In the UK, soccer gained a bad reputation for hooliganism, so \u201cshow him who\u2019s man, Football-fan style\u201d indicates a violent resolution to the conflict. Skinner stops his own flow with \u201cbut\u201d, the moment at which \u201cyou\u201d see your bird (UK for \u201cchick\u201d) French-kissing another bloke (UK for \u201cguy\u201d). The way Skinner\u2019s form matches content is exemplary here: the evening is running nicely along, the dangerous infidelity scheme seems to be going to plan, and Skinner\u2019s flow imitates this, with extensive lists (\u201cclub, flex, bass\u2026\u201d) and enjambements to move the story along without delay. Skinner\u2019s third cautionary tale is about the consequences of infidelity. \u201cYou\u201d, the vaguely-addressed lister/average Joe, has met a good-looking girl and is considering a dalliance with her. Mr. Skinner says: The pushers wants paper! Just pay him and go about your business! For non-Brits: \u201chave him\u201d \u2013 win a fight against him; \u201cto look geez'\u201d \u2013 to try and look rugged and dangerous\n\nThe subject of Skinner\u2019s story is bragging to his friends about how he could take the drug dealer, but the dealer is shady, rolls deep and has a crew behind him.\n\nNice reference to the successful Guy Ritchie crime-caper film about that time, \u201cLock, stock and two smoking barrels\u201d. \u201cJust to recap\u2026\u201d is parodying teacher or conference speaker use of language, and is therefore both cementing and ironising Skinner\u2019s self-chosen role as a teller of didactical tales in this song.\n\nIn consort with this, the somewhat foggy perspective once again returns to direct address: i.e. Skinner is saying that you, listener, could learn something from this cautionary tale. He should have used the money he had (late) on Wednesday to pay his dealer, but instead squanders it on booze. Interesting use of \u201cbar-caf\u00e9\u201d, which seems ironic, perhaps as a tongue-in-cheek attempt to depict someone with ideas above their station applying classy language to their rundown local pub. \u201cBilly\u201d, whoever he his, owes his drug dealer 150 pounds. It\u2019s the classic bind: give in to testosterone and annoy your girlfriend, or renounce a classic opportunity to look hard. Interestingly, this is the first point in the song at which Skinner indicates the perspective. Before, he has rapped without key personal pronouns or verbs (\u201cOut the club\u2026\u201d), and he now shows that, whilst perhaps based on a personal anecdote, this story is also intended as a description of a general situation that could happen to anyone (especially the listener, perhaps the addresse of the vague \u201cyou\u201d) \u2013 and happens night after night up and down the land.\n\nLike the preceeding track \u201cSame old thing\u201d, this song is about the repetitve, dysfunctional nature of working class British life. He is grinning inanely like a Cheshire cat and despite Skinner giving him the eye doesn\u2019t seem to realise what he\u2019s done wrong \u2013 which is infuriating. \u201cfuck you playin' at\u201d is classic UK slang \u2013 shortened from \u201cWhat the fuck are you playing at?\u201d (also popularly \u201cwhat\u2019s your game?\u201d) \u2013 i.e. a challenge to someone behaving out of order. The boisterous drunkards are planning to see who can throw chips the furthest; the takeaway shop staff sense this may lead to violence, and so nervously concentrate on cutting of strips of meat from the doner kebab revolving on a stick. Late-night takeaways are a focal point for very drunk and latently violent types \u2013 hence the comment about \u201cspecial perchant\u201d for the disorderly. I\u2019m guessing that \u201cperchant\u201d is a deliberately adulterated form of the word \u201cpenchant\u201d to create an a rhyme with \u201cmerchant\u201d.\n\n\u201cTo look lairy\u201d is British slang for mad-dogging someone or looking like you want to scrap.\n\nAll of this, meanwhile, is underlayed by radio playing horrible pop music chart entries. Urgh. Late-night Britain can be a horrible thing\u2026 A typical night out in the UK; most nightclubs close in the small hours and a hit of junk-food from the take-away is a regular occurence on the way home (ps. Americans will know \u201ctakeaway\u201d as \u201ctakeout\u201d; \u201cshit-in-a-tray merchants\u201d might be a Skinner neologism, and it certainly describes the product and role of open-late kebab-shops and similar very well\u2026) The Streets is pointing to boredom as a major reason for Britain\u2019s problem with drunken violence: if people, especially men (\u201cgeezers\u201d) are not challenged and excited, their frustration breaks out once their inhibitions are lowered by alcohol. In a jibe at right-wing moralisers, Skinner a.k.a The Streets declares this to be common sense.

This girl is suicide, as the title states, she\u2019s killing herself with her lifestyle.\nThis flow is very similar to Fab\u2019s song She pretends to be happy with her friends so they don\u2019t suspect anything is wrong, but really all the feelings of happiness she had happened long ago and have left her life. \u201cA slash and a gasp\u201d refers to slitting one\u2019s wrists. \u201cA violent blast\u201d refers to a gunblast. Both are methods of suicide. Running a car in a closed garage will fill it with carbon monoxide from the exhaust, which will eventually kill you. Revving the gas produced more exhaust. The girl he loved was beautiful and had style however she went into prostitution, which is highlighted with the imagery of her head bobbing as she gives a blowjob, to pay for her drug addiction. The woman has resorted to prostituion to pay for her drug habit/addiction. Doap also mentions that she was a cheerleader but soon started  experimenting with marijuana (kinebud is high quality weed) and moving to harder drugs. Jawn has many meanings, however, in this context means the girl Doap\u2019s talking about. The girl is obviously lost and worn out from her life\u2019s struggles. Planetary is reminiscing about the past with her and the fact that they had a lot of similar interests and likes, such as marijuana (trees), fitted New Era caps and other clothing lines. She Doesn\u2019t Believe In A God, Heaven or Hell. Unless the Nightmare that is her life turns out to be Hell. She isn\u2019t keen to suffer through multiple suicide attempts, she\u2019s going to do it once and that will be the end of her. Is mainly from the point of view of the girl She cannot see how out of control her life is and how it is damaging her. Drugs literally fucked up her life. She tried drugs and became more dependent and obsessed with them. \u201cYou know my pain, I\u2019m empty inside, my veins pump Novocaine\u201d\n\nShe is dead on the inside and has nothing to live for. The blood that keeps her alive just continues to keep her living in such an empty existence. She is empty and dead inside. She has no reason to live so she might as well just end it He misses her and wishes he could just have her with him just to have a drink The only way he could stop thinking about her is if he shut his mind off aka killing himself\u2026 He\u2019d rather die and stop worrying that living and worrying about her. And here comes the shocker. After all this, she ends up dead in a tragedy. Possibly a result of her flaw, that being her drinking habits although there is no evidence for this being the case in the text. Planet gives the listener the same feeling he would have felt when he read the headlines announcing her death. The suspense: \u201cWell guess what\u201d and then the revelation and disbelief: \u201cwhat the fuck\u201d. After this is said, planet has not much else to say. Thus this being the last song on the album. He wants to do a couple of shots and drink with her, not to exploit her, but simply for old time\u2019s sake. Well according to the last line, she must have been a bit of an alcoholic, because it was her downfall and may have led her down her destructive path. He thought they were \u2018meant to be\u2019, thus he couldn\u2019t fathom why they lost the love that was between them. He still had feelings for her far after the time they split. He believes her life would be complete with him in it. Planet was willing to love her and be real to her and be honest with her; honest enough to not gas her up and tell her she was perfect. She obviously wasn\u2019t mature enough to see how much he really cared about her, probably because other guys said she was flawless, and she liked being with them over having someone critique her. The death of these prized women, who rest in the memories' of the artists, \u201cdie\u201d to the them emotionally, and also become \u201cdead\u201d to their surroundings, and in one case even physically die. These women in Apathy, Doap Nixon, and Planetaries past, last they heard from them, were depressed and on the verge of death. This song is about three girls, each in the past lives of the artists. They can\u2019t seem to psychologically let go of these women even though they are dead to them. \u201cSuicide, it\u2019s a suicide, biddy-bye-bye\u201d is a reference to KRS-One\u2019s \u2018Moshitup\u2019, also referenced heavily in the track by the gravediggaz: 1-800 suicide Drugs that the dentist use to numb ur mouths. It calms and soothes her when she cuts her flesh. A common feeling someone with depression has, the feeling that they need to cut when stressed, because the pain calms them. She is lost in depression, as well as drugs, other men, confusion, and a disappointing life. This line is a clever way of saying what he really meant. What he really meant was that he made her happy, feel useful (the light) when she was depressed (the tunnel). He called her many times, but she just didn\u2019t answer. We all know how that feels, right?

Continued off the previous line about how some people aren\u2019t living this life, there are children starving and drug dealers who sell their drugs cheap so that the poor can afford it. Hodgy understands that he\u2019s living a completely different life than pretty much everyone; he has good things going for him now. He doesn\u2019t care what she has or where she shops. All he knows is that he isn\u2019t going to be the one paying for it all.

He\u2019s willing to help release the dogs of war (the \u201crabid hounds\u201d) in order to effect change, or at least become bothersome to those that keep hip hop in its current state of stagnation.\n\nNote, this presages the response \u201cI told him, \u2018yeah, I gave him one last look and smashed him.\u2019\u201d May be an allusion to the corruption of modern medicine, where medicine has divorced morality, and all they want is to make money off selling you drugs that fix one problem but cause another. Like Asthma Medicine that can make breathing harder, or antidepressants that make you more depressed. Painkillers that cause liver or kidney damage/failure, so they can put you on dialysis and milk you for the cash cow they want you to be. Confuse the police with intelligence before they attack on impulse because most of them live off stupidity. He takes shrooms grown by a junkie.\nIn classical literature such as Dante Alighieri\u2019s Inferno, gluttony is related to crutches and addictions as much as a love of foods. the \u201ctriple-sixers\u201d, or demons, have angles tied up If all the wattage is gone, the power goes out, and the lights shut off.\nDay turns night.\n\nAlso, the story of many comic book \u201cfreaks\u201d with electrical powers draw them from draining electricity from power supplies and electrical boxes. Aesop\u2019s goal is to reflect virtues that he thinks should be present in the current day (\u201cmodern halos\u201d) upon the conservative society (cavemen) through his music. This line also takes on a bit of a dual meaning, as it could allude to Aesop\u2019s innovative take on rap music. The hook is a flip on the hook from \u201cDaylight\u201d, which goes:\n\nAll I ever wanted was to pick apart the day,\nPut the pieces back together my way This is the dark part of the day. Aes tried to stay positive on Daylight, but as the day goes on he is growing tired and frustrated. By this point he\u2019s basically saying \u201cFuck that\u201d and is about to give the dark and un-sugarcoated version of Daylight, hence Nightlight. This is when the monsters come out. Contrast with the line in \u201cDaylight,\u201d\n\nI did not invent the wheel, I was the crooked spoke adjacent\n\nin which Aes claims he is not a visionary, he only held off progress. Here, the direct opposite: he is ages ahead. Aes has been lucky way too long, and he may be getting sick of it, it makes him feel wretched and disgusted that other people who he may deem even more worthy of success than himself have had less luck with it. As this song is the \u2018inversion\u2019 of Daylight, this is the inversion of the Goldilocks tale.  In the original a little girl breaks into the cottage of three bears and procedes to eat their porridge, break their chair, and fall asleep in their bed.  In Aes' rendition the Bears are the invaders. Keeping an eye out for the police. Duck battalion could be cops or fat-ass\u2019d cops (I\u2019m sure of this because of the next line). The character can tell they\u2019re officers because of their funny walk. The events that occurred are like a story from a comic book. Gotham being a dark gritty city in Batman. A swashbuckler was a low rank deck hand on a ship in the days of pirates. When he refers to himself as Sammy Swashbuckler, it implies he\u2019s just following orders and doing as hes told.\n\nThe Pagans are an outlaw motorcycle club or biker gang. Most outlaw motorcycle clubs are mainly associated with a rebellious attitude.\n\n\n\nBy stating he\u2019s a swashbuckler on Pagan threshold he means at the moment he\u2019s passive and obedient but he\u2019s on the verge of completely rebelling from society A possible allusion to a line earlier in the song which describes a tin man blocking his way down the yellow brick road. He calls him Captain because he is in his blocking his path and therefor can only proceed if the tin man allows him to do so, giving the tin man a passive command over Aesop. An allusion to the sister line in \u201cDaylight,\u201d this line is also a reference to the average length of a television commercial. \u201cLife\u2019s a bitch and then you die\nThat\u2019s why we get high\nCause you never know when you\u2019re gonna go\u201d\n-AZ\nhttp://genius.com/Nas-lifes-a-bitch-lyrics\n\nThe common saying \u201clife\u2019s a bitch\u201d means that life is a constant struggle and there isn\u2019t much you can do to change it but keep going. In relation to the next line, Aes is implying that this phrase is an extreme understatement and that life isn\u2019t just a bitch, she\u2019s a drunk that just got off work to catch you fuckin her little sister. In reference to the previous line, he begs the public to stop tearing him apart with criticism or disapproval, so he can recollect what is left of his confidence. Being that it can span two pages, the centerfold is traditionally the largest picture in a magazine, therefore it is deemed the most important. This is a metaphor for the recognition he receives from the public.\n\n\n\nHis night light being the only thing that he has to guide him in the dark is a metaphor for his determination to continue in the rap game as well as his moral compass in doing so.\n\nShimmying across the centerfold means he and his crew spent only a short time in the public\u2019s eye but the harsh criticism he received as a result was enough to dismantle his hope and determination. He sarcastically reassures people that he\u2019s alive, implying that no one has noticed or that no one cares. The verse above \u201cHouston, we have a problem\u2013\u201d links to this verse.\n\nGraffiti artists are counterculture creatures. The counterculture is notorious for speaking the truth. Usually the truth is contradictory to the way the system wants us to believe things. The system thus has to control the message we receive, \u201cbuffing the trains.\u201d The significance of the trains being buffed the same day is so the message will have less of an audience and therefore less of an impact. as the same concept of \u2018Daylight\u2019 aesop says you can only see how hard someone is working when you are working harder then them. In \u2018Nightlight\u2019 the same slacker comes up to Aesop then Aes notices hes a slacker and either disses/ mocks, or walks away to never talk to him again. Aes might be referring to suicide here, saying that the solution to the \u2018American nightmare\u2019 would be suicide. But, Aes is too scared and is talking to some hypothetical character who is helping Aes with suicide because Aes is too afraid to do this himself. Someone else needs to hold the door for him, and he will hold the door for others.\n\nA berserker is an \u201can ancient Norse warrior who fought in a wild frenzy.\u201d Now it seems that perhaps the door was for a prison cell, or the door to living a wild, crazy, messed-up life, where you\u2019re going to have someone guarding/protecting/watching you at all times. Aes is contrasting the \u2018American nightmare\u2019 with the American dream and saying that we\u2019re all just watching the TV monitor; it\u2019s a nightmare Aesop is saying that his achievements (his wingspan) are attracting the ire of others, causing their views to turn against him (casting shadows on their views) A reference to the wizard of oz, aesop feels he is on a mission to find the answer to his wishes (the wizard) but he is stuck behind others who are broken or louder then he is (the squeaky wheel gets the oil) A famous (mis)quote from the Apollo 13 movie, an adaptation of the conversation from the original mission:\n\nSwigert: \u2018Okay, Houston, we\u2019ve had a problem here.\u2019\nHouston: \u2018This is Houston. Say again please.\u2019\nLovell: \u2018Houston, we\u2019ve had a problem. We\u2019ve had a main B bus undervolt.\u2019 Aesop is saying he paces his game to finish at the end of time (he will go on forever)\n\nZero hour is a reference to the doomsday clock, during the cold war a symbolic doomsday clock was established to show how close the world was to thermonuclear war. at midnight (the zero hour) the world would be racked with thermonuclear war. As of 2012 the clock is at 11:55 He\u2019s perhaps declaring that even when you hide behind an alias, at night, in your computer, you\u2019re still a cretin. Yellow bricks is a reference to The Wizard of Oz. The yellow brick road is a road several characters would follow to make their dreams come true . Red bricks refer to a wall which is a metaphor or depending on the situation, an actual obstacle. So when you reahc an obstacle (red bricks) you get a hold of yourself (head gripped) and the obstacle will turn into a path to your dreams and wishes (yellow bricks) =] As in the twin song, Aesop is saying that he is innovative (as per \u201cShackle me not\u201d) and he is saying through \u201cclean logic progression\u201d that this song will be composed of \u201clogical assertions with justification\u201d. Aesop is first declaring that this song is the opposite of Daylight. Which in itself is problematic because at night, there is no light. Suggests that remaining in the gutter is never an option for him. Every time he returns he must \u201cget the fuck up\u201d In constrast to \u201cDaylight\u201d\u2019s line on a similar thread, which says \u201cStomach full of halo kibbles\u201d. That line can be defined as he\u2019s filled with good intentions. To contradict, Aes now says he\u2019s filled with diner food, which\u2026well, is pretty damn disgusting sometimes. This could reference bad influence, or bad outcomes. Since he\u2019s constantly being pursued by these rusty rappers, he can\u2019t get a moment to go alone and put some mileage on his new Adidas. He kisses the speaker wire because he knows during a lot of his concerts and shows the speaker wire sometimes dies out, get disconnected, or he forgets to bring it with him. You can\u2019t entertain your fans without a speaker wire, so he know how important it is. Aes can\u2019t stop to rest right now because the people who always doubted him or felt they were better than him will think he has given in. they don\u2019t realize that they will have to deal with hardships in their lives too, and that they are not as high above him as they think\n\n\u201cCovered wagons\u201d implies settlers of some sort, perhaps artistic ones who are trying to blaze a trail or pioneer a new style. He\u2019s implying that this attempt to go somewhere new artistically is doomed to failure.\n\n\n\nThe Ghost of Christmas Past is a reference to the Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens.\nIn the story the ghost of Christmas past shows the protagonist Ebenezer Scrooge his unhappy childhood, thus explaining why he\u2019s so greedy and miserable as an adult. This implies that eventually those who are laughing at Aes will regret having done so, once they are made to see the error of their ways.\n\n\n\nThere is the possibility that this \u2018bizarro Aes\u2019 is making a misogynist statement (this is after all, a sort of dark-twist on his original song Daylight) that would be out of character for the otherwise cerebral MC.\n\nHowever it is more likely this is meant to be a metaphor for something one uses and discards. One neither loves nor deeply values a blow-up doll.  It is something inherently disposable that is put away once one is finished with it.  The implication is that the comfortable consumerist society we live in will one day cease to exist.\n\nIt could also be a reference to the populace who are being metaphorically fucked by the powers-that-be, without consideration of our motivations, aspirations, desires. Aes is essentially saying,\n\u201cYou won\u2019t be laughing when we get tired of your shit.\u201d Triple sixers (666) \u2013 demons.  He might be alluding to the fact that rappers that have important things to say or have actual talent (\u201cangels\u201d) are kept \u201croped in the basement\u201d, or aren\u2019t given the recognition they deserve, or haven\u2019t in the past.  (The \u201ctriple-sixers\u201d could be referring to major label reps that encourage and promote bland, tasteless commercial rap, using it solely as a product, and don\u2019t give true artists with true shit to talk about the opportunity to get their work well-distributed and publicized.)  He \u201clocates modern halos\u201d, meaning he finds reasons to encourage aspiring rappers (or artists in general, or people in general) to keep doing what they\u2019re doing, and he \u201cpasses them out to the pavement\u201d, as in he dishes the \u201chalos\u201d (or these positive reinforcement ideas)  out to friends and other artists who are struggling for recognition and respect in the scene. This might translate to \u201clet me take action against this bullshit by skyrocketing myself as far the fuck away from it as I can possibly get.\u201d\n\n\u2018Wild Style\u2019 was a 1983 Hip-Hop film following the life of a young New York Graffiti artist.\n\n\n\n\u2018Pluto Orbit\u2019 is a reference to the irregular orbit of the dwarf planet Pluto, one reason it has been downgraded from full planet-status.\n\n\n\nTogether this refers to Aesop Rock\u2019s style.  It is both tied to the old-school origins of pluto, but also like the orbit of Pluto uniquely erratic and unpredictable.\nPlus, check out the size of his vocabulary. Seven deadly \u201cstains\u201d, seven deadly sins.  \u201cCrystal conscience\u201d is a metaphor for a shared religious belief system, which is why the \u201cstains\u201d are \u201cadhered\u201d to it.  the result is a dead-beat trying to make a dollar off a bomb threat (referring to terrorism, fanaticism, and maybe even war itself.) He\u2019s asking you to \u201cfathom\u201d (understand) the \u201csplicing\u201d (as in gene splicing) of a \u201cmajor-league low-life\u201d (his own opinion of himself, a loser) with \u201canti-hero earthworm mentality\u201d (his first album was \u201cMusic for Earthworms\u201d, and he\u2019s an anti-hero cuz he ain\u2019t in the game for the money, he\u2019s in it for the love of self-expression).  And the result of this combo is \u201cGodzilla\u201d, as in he\u2019s risen from being a \u201clow-life\u201d to doing something of merit, and has been true to himself since the beginning, and is now unstoppable. You can dream and speculate all you want.  But what really counts is action.  You gotta make your goals a reality, or they\u2019re nothing more than beautiful origami dreams.\n\nACCEPTED SUGGESTION: He\u2019s also pointing out that it\u2019s easy to make a working facsimile, but that simply doesn\u2019t compare to the real thing\u2013 fake rappers can make a song that sounds meaningful, but it far from is. \u201cFriend of polar nature,\u201d Polar, meaning opposite in this context, is a reference to the character Aesop assumes in his song \u201cDaylight.\u201d\n\nIn \u201cNightlight,\u201d Aes is a man of constant turmoil and hatred, his polar opposite would be \u201call peace,\u201d as in Daylight\u2019s more optimistic tones. Their search for similar stars means they have the same goals, (both songs have similar subject matter) but their inability to be associated with one another means they\u2019ll employ different methods to achieve them, as well as the fact that the two philosophies examined in \u201cDaylight\u201d and \u201cNightlight\u201d cannot co-exist. We all know life is fuckin hard.  It\u2019s interesting that he uses the word \u201cmarketplace\u201d in reference to finding the \u201cG-spot\u201d, which is sort of an allusion to the idea that people (the villagers) think that the answer to life lies in commerce, or money.  Maybe that\u2019s why she doesn\u2019t feel y'all, or share any similar interests.  Because maybe people who think money is the key to true happiness are not getting what life is truly about, which is why, in his own words, he calls \u2018em assholes.  And maybe Ace is one of 'em.  (\u201cMaybe I\u2019m just an asshole.\u201d)  As in \u201cmaybe I haven\u2019t figured out the real beauty of life yet\u201d. This song is, as I\u2019m sure everybody already knows, the antithesis of \u201cDaylight\u201d. Whereas in Daylight he\u2019s referring to himself and his life and his art in a positive manner, in this song he\u2019s being straight up with the aggression. In \u201cDaylight\u201d he wants to \u201cpick apart the day\u201d so he can put the pieces back together his way, as in draw from his life experiences and express his perspective on them through his rhymes, which has a happy connotation.\n\nIn Nightlight, he\u2019s saying that he (also) wants to do it to chastise people, to criticize humanity and aspects of society and human behavior that he doesn\u2019t like.  He expands upon that by expressing that he\u2019s \u201cbeached in a city of lost barnacles and leeches\u201d, as in surrounded by miserable, selfish assholes. It\u2019s a diss. He\u2019s saying that he\u2019ll lay his kicks to rest (quit rapping) when he\u2019s impressed (by other artists) so he staples them to his feet (essentially saying that he doesn\u2019t think he\u2019ll ever be impressed).\nDoesn\u2019t solely have to be about rapping, but I\u2019m pretty convinced it has something to do with it from the \u201cyou won\u2019t be laughing\u201d section in which he disses others for not being as Godzilla as him.

The song finds the Latino pop star singing of her spellbound attraction to a lover \u2013 \u201cI\u2019m into you,\u201d she repeats in the hook.\nAccording to Lopez, her favorite male rapper is Lil Wayne, and lo and behold, Weezy crops on this track contributing his clever wordplay.\nThe song was co-written by English singer-songwriter Taio Cruz, who you will probably know from his hit singles \u201cBreak Your Heart\u201d and \u201cDynamite.\u201d It was produced by StarGate and features the Norwegian production team\u2019s usual synth-heavy beat.\nLopez found Lil Wayne to be contrary to how she expected him to be. She explained to MTV News: \u201cWhen I got on the phone with him to talk about the record, I thought he was going to be like, \u2018Hey, what\u2019s up, J.Lo?\u2019 and instead he was like, \u2018Yes, ma'am.\u2019 I was like, \u2018Are you going to be able to do this record?

I\u2019ll get it done this week, ma'am.\u2019\u201d\nLopez flew on April 2, 2011 to the Mayan archaeological site Chichen Itza in Mexico to film scenes for the music video.

I called my cousins and they were like, \u2018It\u2019s William Levy. You\u2019ve got to get William Levy!\u2019\u201d\nCruz originally wrote the song for another artist. He told Billboard magazine. \u201cBeing a songwriter, I do that quite a lot. As it happens, they all stay in this massive big pot of songs that I\u2019ve written. We play them for different people and different people get inspired and I think J.Lo must have heard it and absolutely loved it.\u201d Sometimes when you meet someone that makes you change who you really are makes you think different about life, and sometimes opens your eyes to new opportunities. A four leaf clover, when found, is a sign of forthcoming good fortune. It can be a reference to his song \u201cRight Above It\u201d where he says,\n\nLife is a beach, i\u2019m just playin' in the sand.\n\nSo saying \u201cI live on the beach\u201d he means he\u2019s living life. As we know, Airplanes all \u201cfly\u201d and since his girl is too fly for him, he will compliment her features by being her \u201cfuel\u201d.\n\nJet fuels expensive but Weezy can handle it. Weezy is so hot he gets all the girls wet for him. The wetsuit is his only option to keep getting at it!!! Falling for someone means falling in love with them. Taking this literally, you would need a parachute to safely land. When previous tensions build in a relationship, people want to focus on the good and leave the bad stuff behind (old shit). The restroom is also a location where you take a shit. As we can tell from his last album, Weezy is clearly \u201cNot a Human Being,\u201d and so one of his many home locations is on the moon, you can usually catch Weezy relaxing on Mars though. Lil Wayne has many nicknames, including the name \u201cTune,\u201d which his grandmother gave him when he was a little boy.

He talks about that in a world of total anarchy and no more civilization, who do we hope to save us?\n\nThe beginning and ending of teh song are from Jim Jones' infamous KoolAid speech. This recording is from the \u201cdeath tape\u201d of The People\u2019s Temple led by pastor Jim Jones. Throughout the recording, members committed suicide by drinking poisoned Flavor-aid(generic Kool-aid) at Jonestown, Guyana.\nThe mass suicide at Jonestown was the largest group of Americans dying prior to 9/11 Reference to the Holy Bible. When Satan and the evil spirits reach complete power and have taken over this world. God will send an angel to throw Satan in the lake of fire. Hell and the lake of fire is often misinterpreted when in some beliefs it means when the world has reached complete chaos and God destroys it and takes his children back to the homeland. Kind of like starting from scratch? When Tech N9ne was young, he used to go to abandoned houses and look for \u201cghosts\u201d to find something supernatural or paranormal to find out for sure if there is something greater than humans among us Man destroys everything. So, how can we reasonably believe a book written by man? The only miracle Tech acknowledges here is that people still are believing in God. During war and fighting, the only savior is guns, not God or Allah or any other higher power. If/when man as a race destroys the world, and until God or any other higher power comes down and shows Tech anything different, he\u2019s going to protect his family the only way he knows is efficient: with good ol' firearms. He is referring to a nine millimeter gun when he says nina. A reoccurring theme of this song is that Tech is not sure what he believes in, but you better believe he will forever take steps to ensure his safety, aka he will kill off all of his enemies with guns. The \u201cgood book\u201d referring to, of course, the Bible. The \u201cten plagues\u201d are referring to the Ten Plagues of Egypt. They were the ten calamities that were brought upon Egypt to convince the Pharaoh to let the Israelite slaves free. If God shows Tech a sign that He\u2019s there, Tech\u2019ll believe in Him undoubtedly. Referring to the song Praise the Lord and Pass the Ammunition by Frank Loesser. The right hand is a place of distinction and favor.\n\n(Genesis 48:13-19) Today\u2019s generation aren\u2019t exactly that religious compared to the previous generation. If I ever come close to death, I want to believe that there will be someone waiting for me on the other side. Tech is most likely referring to the \u201cwar on terror\u201d with this line. Many people believe that George W. Bush lied about the real reason for the war, making it a \u201choax.\u201d I don\u2019t seem like the type to pray, but I do. Angels are believed to have wings. It seems weird to believe that we have to worship a god or go to Hell. Tech always saying he\u2019s all 6\u2019s and 7\u2019s. 6 is supposedly evil, and 7 is godly. Creationism is the belief that earth and all of the beings walking on it were created by God. Darwinism  is the belief of evolution. Tech doesn\u2019t believe in any of this. If Tech pointed out that theese didn\u2019t happen, then he would have religious nuts protesting, and theoretically have the verse removed from the song. The tenth and final plague was the death of the first born of all humans and animals who do not have their doorposts marked.\n\n(Exodus 11:1-5) The ninth plague was darkness.\n\n(Exodus 10:21-29) Plagues 6, 7 and 8 were the unhealable boils, hail and thunder, and a mass of locusts.\n\n(Exodus 9:8-35 & Exodus 10:1-20) The fifth plague is disease on livestock. (Exodus 9:1-7) Plagues 2, 3 and 4 state that there will be a mass of frogs, lice, and flies.\n\nExodus 8:1-30 Exodus 7:14-25: Water turned to blood killing all fish and other water life.

If one does not put everything they have in, the turnout will not be as great.\n\nThis is also a reference to the Gnarls Barkley hit \u201cCrazy\u201d released in 2006. There is a similar line in the song that goes like this\n\nMy heroes had the heart to lose their lives out on a limb This is a play on the word \u201cstages:\u201d\n\n\nPeriod in the course of a process\nArea in which artist perform\n\n\n\nWhen an artist is scheduled for a performance on stage it is called a gig, so Shad is cleverly letting people know what stage he is referring to. TSOL is the name of the album that this song caps off. In an interview with HipHopDX, Shad explains what TSOL means:\n\nT.S.O.L. is \u201clost\u201d backwards. I like the idea that when you\u2019re lost, you don\u2019t know when you\u2019re lost a lot of times. If it\u2019s backwards, when you look in the mirror, that\u2019s when you know that it\u2019s backwards. Sometimes, when you\u2019re lost, it takes looking at something familiar, or some sort of realization.\n\nHowever, it doesn\u2019t necessarily have to stand for \u201clost\u201d backwards. As Shad explained in another interview:\n\nTSOL doesn\u2019t stand for any one thing. I just liked the sound of it. It represents the insufficiency of language to express feeling and ideas, which is why we have art. It can stand for a number of things: \u201cthe struggle of love,\u201d \u201ctruth shall overcome lies,\u201d \u201clost\u201d backward. It\u2019s representative of the ambiguity of life in a way. Shad is mocking, saying that the opposite of him (the bi-polar side) is just a parakeet, a bird often known for repeating what other people say. Shad says that he just conforms to the norm and does as they do and talks what they say. Gold Diggers are often referred to as people (usually women) who marry or get with someone famous for their money (symbolically represented by suits). Shad refers to how we also follow suit, meaning that we conform to the norm.

Platonic means intimate and affectionate, but not sexual. All the girl wants to do is be close and romantic, she doesn\u2019t wanna have sex or anything. Mr. Hyde was a Schizophrenic with the symptom of multiple personalities. He refers to him and the girl as Mr. and Mrs. Hyde because one minute they may love eachother, and the next they\u2019re seperated. Metaphorically speaking, they\u2019re Mr. and Mrs. Hyde. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strange_Case_of_Dr_Jekyll_and_Mr_Hyde) It is not traditional to be single when you are an adult, so Tyga is basically saying that if you screw up your relationship by hurting the \u201cright person\u201d, you will be single or \u201cwrong\u201d for the rest of your life, and keep regretting it. While he\u2019s trying to create that perfect love, she contrast the idea. Now he\u2019s seeing her true personality behind the \u201cmask\u201d. Referring to the previous line, he painted the perfect picture (tried to create the perfect love for them), but she never understood his art (she never seemed to get the relationship, or even care about it). The more he tries and she doesn\u2019t try, the more he sees her true colors, and now he realizes how ugly her personality is \u2013 she\u2019s a monster. Though the guy/girl might seem not to remember what happened when they were dating the person they truly do remember every minute just choose to try and hide it deep in the heart and mind. She went above and beyond and traveled long distances to see him and make him happy. The simple down to earth things he misses about her. Cold women just fall in love and break up in the end, he\u2019s reffering to the women that do this constantly All of sudden\u2026all liquored up and having sex she misses him They would get \u201ccrazy\u201d for each other and he considered her his \u201cride or die chick\u201d/ Premenstrual Syndrome happens when a female is nearing her period often they will become irritable, emotional, and generally not themselves. he doesnt want to hurt you. he knows hes just gonna hit it and quit it. Besides hes got the throne waiting on him enough of the lovey shit he just wants the bank there are too many girls waiting for tyga so he cant focus on one \u201con to the next on on to the next one\u201d is she lets him smash it now then blame it on the alcohol He knows he has to let her go but wants to have sex until the dark sky turns light. Sex isn\u2019t the only thing involved with love and he\u2019s finding that out the hard way. Whatever happened to love and being happy? Nobody is happy with just having someone to love them anymore. He\u2019s aroused with lust, in other words, he loves her because he\u2019s so attracted to her. \u201cHe loved her and now he\u2019s backwards\u201d, in other words, he loves her because he\u2019s having sex with her; he\u2019s not having sex because he loves her. The idea of love and sex are backwards. even though he did alot it still wasn\u2019t enough, but hes still hoping it could come back She wants to know if he loves her but if he doesn\u2019t, she doesn\u2019t want her heartbroken. This chorus reflects a situation in which the relationship with the girl you love doesn\u2019t work out but when you see her again, you\u2019re reminded of the feelings you have for her.\n\nThis is part of the Adele song, Someone Like You.

Idiom that means that you\u2019re finished, there is no hope left for better things.\n\nSo might as well try to enjoy the moment. Similar to a movie rating, Big Boi describes the situation in this household as being graphic, containing mild violence and language unsuitable for children.\n\n\n\nThe later half of the line plays on the famously horrific 1991 film Silence of the Lambs. in 1979, Big Boi would\u2019ve been 4 years old, living in the Dirty South It is in your best interest to make smart decisions to keep your distance from people or situations that could have a negative effect on your life, or put you in danger. No matter what, the consequences of your actions catch up with you, and some times, you can\u2019t just run away.\n\nThe line \u201ccouldn\u2019t abort that case\u201d suggests that maybe the character Big Boi is talking to aborted their child because they were running from that responsibility, effectively meaning \u201cYou couldn\u2019t run away from this problem\u201d Big Boi, noting one of the few exceptions to his above rule, when temporary freedom is literally for sale \u201cHappiness is done\u201d  Too late for anything other that being unhappy and giving up Many unhappy people turn to alcohol to quell their sadness. \u201cFlip that smile upside down now\u201d is the reverse of the idiom \u201cTurn that frown upside down\u201d that\u2019s usually told to frowning folks. Unfortunately, ending sadness is a lot harder than just trying to be happy. Another way of saying \u201cmoney can\u2019t buy you happiness\u201d Most families work miracles to give their child a reason to smile during the holidays, however some overspend and end up in huge amounts of debts. In the end, the pressure to pay these off breaks up a few families. But hey, always look on the bright side, joy can always be found in the least inexpensive of things\u2026if only they figured that out in the first place When all happiness/hope is gone there are two options.\nA) Start repenting\nB) Go ape shit crazy\n\nIf your faith is a little low, a seems the better option to revive a low spirit. A guy from the hood finally got caught flouting the law and was put in jail, where you\u2019ll find most of the realest O.G\u2019s in the game\u2026hint, hint. Going to jail when you\u2019re the breadwinner of the household is bad news for your family. Words of wisdom from Daddy Fat Sax: let other people screw up and make stupid decisions \u2013 focus on getting your diploma/degree/certificate/ged/etc.\n\n\n\nGraduate also has deeper implications than just in an educational sense. Graduate implies that you have moved on from something for good, and it\u2019s behind you. In life don\u2019t panic and protect your ass. Be stoic and don\u2019t let others know you\u2019re afraid, or else others might take advantage of you. \u201cGoose is cooked\u201d is an idiom meaning all hope is gone. Santa Claus is fake, just like 80s frauds Milli Vanilli were. Don\u2019t know Milli and their controversy? All summed up in YouTube video. Sir Lucious Left Foot is one of Big Boi\u2019s many names.

Immortal Tech)\n\nAfter laying it all out there in the 1st and 2nd verses, Lupe just goes crazy on the 3rd verse, switching between styles nearly every other bar, but he reverses the order in which he goes through each style. Lupe joins the pantheon of materialistic rhymers if only for 4 bars.\n\nDon\u2019t worry he hasn\u2019t sold out yet, keep listening.

The style flips back to the pimp, or mack-type of rapper. Talkin' about his pimp walk and bragging about his power in the hood. Here, he is switching the style of rappin' and is showing his versatility and ability to be any kind of rapper he chooses to be. The poor rapper is coming through here. The broke dude having to ride public transportation with only a pocket full of change while working hard at pizza joints.\n\nA humble man rapping about real-life situations. Here, he raps with a positive vibe and stresses the importance of education and respect of women. Some rappers make a career out of this style of rap, sometimes called \u201cconscious rappers\u201d.

This is a reference to Lupe mentor, and one of his idols, Jay-Z. He is known for his Yankees hat laid low on his brows. This personality focuses on the vowel sounds and consistently spreading that across his bars. He says it in almost a hypnotic way, hence \u201cLu now rules you\u201d indicating that he\u2019s putting listeners under a spell. Lupe is explaining how he\u2019s created an experiment, a science project if you will. Every time he says \u201cswitch,\u201d he changes personalities and therefore content. . In the old Batman TV series, Batman used to have a phone, sort of like a direct line from Commissioner Gordon to Batman. This phone was all red and when you slap someone hard enough you turn their faces red.

It features Vince Staples.\n\nThe form is classic hip hop: two verses and a third verse that the two MCs collaborate on. This form allows the listener to be acquainted with the perspective of both MCs before they come together, from their separate or totally unrelated positions, to conclude the narrative.\n\nIn the song, Mike G is struggling with his rapping game, losing his passion after finding that the lifestyle of rap and the actual art do not entail one another. Vince Staples is a boyish troublemaker whose main dilemma is his controlling Grandmother. On the third verse though, they unite with the common, essential Odd Future theme: murder.\n\nSong is produced by Syd Tha Kyd and Left Brain. She seems to be possessed. Vince doesn\u2019t seem to like her much anyways, she took his video games aways. He didn\u2019t do it because he\u2019s a rebel, he actually didn\u2019t see anything wrong with it. He hasn\u2019t gotten the fame he feels he so rightfully deserves, along with the material possessions he\u2019s garnered. All the material things he gained distracted his perception of how he was changing. The clothes, money, and women couldn\u2019t make him better on the inside, though. Mike G never really had a great home life\u2026so now that he\u2019s having success and making money he let his head get a little bloated. An Odd Future affiliate that allegedly had beef with Tyler about his place within the hip hop collective. Known for his common themes of murder, rape and general criminal ideology. Clearly Vince didn\u2019t enjoy his third grade but in fourth grade his luck grew and he ended up fucking (or even murdering; you never know with Vince) fat black girls that he now calls dumb sluts for having the audacity to hook up with him, a perspective of the vulnerability of young females these days. A dyke is a lesbian with more masculine characteristics. For this example, Vince meets a blonde one (presumably called Charlie, a unisex name) that he calls Chuck because of her previously mentioned masculine features. Mike G don\u2019t give a f, OF don\u2019t give a f, DGAF is Mike G\u2019s mentality First time he made a couple bucks from rapping he blew it all on useless sh*t, Mike G is now more mature and has gained more wisdom. Taught Rick a lesson!  His only focus: He\u2019s talking about his paycheck \u2013 the more zeros the better! Klondike is a brand\u2019s name for a type of dessert that is made up of vanilla ice-cream with a thin layer of chocolate coating.\n\nIts universal jingle slogan is: \u201cWhat would you do for a Klondike Bar?\u201d 24 hour plumbing service This hook is said only by Vince Staples though they are Mike G\u2019s lyrics to show that there are similarities between the two artists. This hook is said by both artists to show that they see each other eye to eye. He found birth control pills in his teacher\u2019s purse, stole them, and then she had two kids! The raps he was writing were not from the heart \u2013 they were empty \u2013 merely written to make him some quick cash. He didn\u2019t have the initiative to get ahead and truly distinguish himself; he was waiting for fame to come to him. His father told him to be responsible and save money but Mike ignored him. He\u2019s using a paraplegic\u2019s bus pass to escape.\n\nACCEPTED COMMENT: Paraplegics can\u2019t feel anything from the waist down, so if they have their bus pass in their pockets, they won\u2019t feel it if Vince just takes them. By shaving his facial hair he\u2019ll be altering his appearance significantly enough that he could blame the murder on his neighbor, who\u2019s drunk enough to be unable to defend himself against this allegation. He thought that he had a kick-ass hiding spot but then realized that that;s the same place he dumped the dead body; if he stays there they will find him and the body, so he should get the hell out of there! Referring to \u2018Eyes Wide Shut\u2019 (1999, Stanley Kubrick), a film focused on aberrant sexual appetites, Mike G and Vince Staples parallel the narrative with the 5 white sensuously voracious girls they\u2019ll share. Since he knocked out Rick with a brick he thought he was a tough guy and went onto the Special Ed bus to punch all the retarded kids. The teacher called his house and his grandmother was pissed.\n\nLittle Bus = Small Yellow Bus That Special Ed Kids Ride On. He basically raped some bitch, the neighbors heard, called the cops, and he had to dip out. Pretty much what people say about Mike G. The only time they\u2019ll be with a lame person is when they\u2019ve got a gun to the lame\u2019s head, or when he\u2019s raping and murdering the lame\u2019s grandma. He\u2019d rather rob niggas to get his money than work like everybody else  By being a rebel, he achieved success. Because he stood up for what he believed in, he stood out from the crowd.  Vince is saying his granny is making him do her laundry as a punishment, but he won\u2019t do it until she tells him a bunch of information about his life that she\u2019s kept secret from him, like who his dad is.  Reference to Jack The Ripper, and English serial killer from the 19th Century. Gotta fly solo cause you can\u2019t trust anyone He sucks at aiming with guns so he did target practice with dogs.

In classic Wayne fashion, this girl can now be characterized as having been hit and Quitted Not an image I ever expected to analyze, but fairly straight forward none-the-less. If you\u2019ve had contact with the \u2018differently abled,\u2019 you shouldn\u2019t have much trouble picturing two of them bumping uglies.\n\nSimply put, I\u2019d expect it\u2013both retard sex and the sex Wayne is having in this scenario\u2013to be sloppy, wet, and filled with groaning. Wayne follows up his previous surreal line with something more earthly. While the line prior used banging stars as a metaphor for getting really lifted, this time Wayne shifts the meaning of \u2018stars\u2019 from heavenly orbs to terrestrial celebrities.\n\n\n\nWeezy F. Baby admits he his been engaging in sexual relations with famous women. While he is remiss in revealing any identities, he is quick to announce the quality of the sexual organs on said celebrities. Not only is he hooking up with young, gorgeous women, Wayne makes these mystery VIPs so excited that underwear is difficult to remove from their jeans, or drawers, while undressing. This not-so-subtle reference to smoking marijuana cigarettes suggests that Wayne is intoxicated. Extremely intoxicated.\n\nSince getting \u2018high\u2019 is slang for smoking reefer, if one is exceedingly high they are said to be among the stars. Wayne being Wayne, he is not content to simply chill with the celestial bodies, but must engage in intercourse. The simple implication of this line is that anyone performing sexual acts for Lil Wayne (esp. in his car) will become famous. If your plans are different, it\u2019s time to shit or get off the pot. Or, in internet slang, GTFO. A popular vacation and party spot, South Beach is located in the city of Miami Beach, Florida. Its temperate climate makes for ideal ocean weather and Wayne procedes to capitalize by taking his sexual adventure, referenced in the previous lines, from land to sea. Throughout his work, Wayne makes several facts (his verdict in the case of Money v. Bitches, the constant exercising of his Second Amendment rights) abundantly clear. His own uniqueness is another common theme, often extrapolated through the refrain \u201cthey don\u2019t make em like me no more\u201d.\n\nHere, Wayne couples this idea with a concept near and dear to the hearts of countless listeners\u2013the plight of the dinosaurs. Since they are extinct, dinosaurs have not been made for millions of years. Similarly, rappers like Wayne are no longer produced. Since the previous line is decidedly tranquil, here Wayne fills the need to reaffirm his badassery. Using wordplay (go on becomes goon if you delete the space) Weezy evokes his repeated declaration that he is a goon, or a real man.\n\nWhile there is some debate regarding the true meaning of the term \u2018goon,\u2019 this writer is positive it is not a reference to the classic Goonies film. I must assume that Wayne intends the southern meaning of the term (described above) and not the northern version, which refers to hired thugs. Coupled with a playful version of his stage name, Wayne\u2019s peaceful assurance is meant to lull his prey into a false sense of security. Whether she is aware or not, the \u2018Lil Mama\u2019 in question will be performing fellatio on Lil Wayne later this evening. For obvious reasons, Mr. Carter does not enjoy when Cover Girl, Maybelline, or Carmex products come in contact with his crush stick. Thus, he requests those cosmetics are removed in advance. Also, this line references the viral video \u2018Lip Gloss\u2019 which is by the artist Lil Mama. Besides the fact they obviously share the same name, Lil Wayne often aggrandizes himself as the \u201cgreatest rapper alive\u201d thus making this comparison even more fitting as Wayne Gretzky is often referred to as the greatest hockey player of all time. More specifically, these lines are implying that if a lady\u2019s downstairs were compared to hockey, Lil Wayne would procede to dominate at the same level as \u201cThe Great One\u201d Wayne\u2019s way of introducing himself, despite needing no introduction. Not only is he a boss in the Rick Ross sense and even the way Springsteen used it, Weezy is also president of the record label Young Money Entertainment, making him a real live boss.

In this society Bolic describes the narrative given by the government is rejected hence their (the government\u2019s) idea of good is rejected.The villains become heroes.

In V for Vendetta, V states: People should not be afraid of their governments. Governments should be afraid of their people. Diabolic tweaks this to say that the government should fear the right to bear arms, because that is what the law is TRULY for. Stopping an oppressive authority from taking over. A hollow point is an expanding bullet that has a pit or hollowed out shape in its tip, generally intended to cause the bullet to expand upon entering a target in order to decrease penetration and disrupt more tissue as it travels through the target.\n\nDiabolic wants to have a country where corrupt politicians are executed. It cuts to Diabolic pretending to be on a squad car radio, talking about the angry mob. He\u2019s hinting that he has created a mob so large that they\u2019ve taken it from the police. When you have an angry mob, the police will usually be attacked, and so they get cautious, and if it gets out of control, riot police and weapons will be used.

Canibus suggested in his song \u201cRip the Jacker 2 Infinity\u201d that he may have acromegaly. Excessive sweating and odor are among the symptoms. Melatonin is a hormone in the pineal gland, that regulates the production of melanin in the body. Melanin itself, is the pigment that regulates skin color, and for Africans, gives them their distinctive look \u2013 the dark skin, because of an abundance of the pigment in the skin. Canibus expects a better challenge from his weaker opponents Soda when first poured into a cup is all bubbly and fizzy. First, understand that this is a battle rap opus, and as such, Canibus has come to rip (everyone on the set and many out there). So, this line IMO is an indication that there\u2019s many people that are listening to the lines he\u2019s just fired (check the intro to his verse), and are definitely not happy about the challenge he\u2019s already set up.\n\nAnticipating the reactions of your opponent(s) and exploiting or laying them bare, is a powerful technique in battle rap, and Canibus, being who he is, knows how to apply such. This line is a testament to that technique. This is a reference to the hook on the track \u201cHip-hop music\u201d by the artist \u201cPhanatik\u201d of popular christian hip-hop group \u201cCross movement\u201d released in 2005. On the track, he (phanatik) embarks on an exegesis of hip-hop\u2019s history,it\u2019s effects on society both good and bad and then ends up debunking the notion held within most christian groups that hip-hop is evil. The hook has gone on to become somewhat of an anthem not only among christian hip-hop circles but has even been adopted on occasion by emcees outside the christian hip-hop circle\n(www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYcKW8KSoic)\n\nHip Hop is more than just music \u2013 it\u2019s a psychological force, for those who\u2019ve mastered to wield it properly. These four civilizations are widely considered to be of the most important in our history.\nTheir innovations in language, art, science, technology, etc. set the wheels of creation in motion which led to the structure of most modern societies today.\n\n\n\nCanibus claims that he is aware of this and is still certain that he is unmatched in his ability of innovation and knowledge. 50 bars is a reference to rapping a verse that is 50 bars in length with no chorus or hook to separate it Lyrically, no one can match up to the prowess of The God Canibus.\n\n\n\nNuScribe Scribe. The risk to attain the reward is greater than the reward itself. He\u2019s saying you\u2019ll get more from the work and effort put in, rather than the reward you acquire in the end. First featured artist with Rakim on the track I\u2019ll Bust \u2018Em, You Punish 'Em\"\n\nRAKIM ALLAH : GOD E=MC*2 Intrusive means someone that intrudes. Canibus by his own admission is the most intrusive in his genre \u2013 Battle Rap. His attacks on other (emcees) go deeper\u2026 Tasting victory is a famous metaphor in popular culture 50 bars is a reference to rapping a verse that is 50 bars in length with no chorus or hook to separate it. Nowhere to run is a film directed by Robert Harmen.\n\n\n\nIt is also a song made by the Hip Hop outfit Gravediggaz Solar cycle is according to wikipedia a periodic change in the amount of irradiation from the sun that is experienced on Earth. For a more ellaborate explanation of the cycle Canibus is reffering to click here. \u201cthat prime\u201d is a reference to when Canibus was seen as a lyrical God in battling. Since that time Canibus has evolved into a more mature conscious rapper\n\nHe is past the 33o of magick \u2013 the laws of the lesser 137 can not determine his progress anymore. In 2009 44 tons of rotting Bison meat) that had been left for 2 years made the town of Bridgewater in South Dakota smell terrible. This is a reference to a time when Canibus was percieved as lyricaly immortal. Antagonism is hostility that results in active resistance or is the condition of the opposing principle.\n\nDon\u2019t fight your person \u2013 meditate, zen. Attain the grand relaxation \u2013 trance. Canibus is instructing his audience to calm down and listen carefully to the content in his lyrics. Canibus is reffering to himself as a \u201chigh profile target\u201d. The phrase Seargent Armpits is either a) a reference of comedic value or b) is an actual code reference to himself. It would appear that the context of this lyric is of an MI5 Agent and they are the ones that monitor his bodily functions. Twitteris a common communication network on the internet. The first phrase he is telling us that he is extremly intelligent. The second phrase is a metaphor which means he is trying to get his lyrics out there to more people. He is stating that what is inconvenient is conveniant and this is due to the social repurcusions of allowing an inconvenient truth.\n\nUsing dogmatic books of the god, like the bible, is alone sufficient to project man into the realm of gods \u2013 experiencing divinity, and thus truth. But the book itself, void of the power. He is reffering to his position in the music industry. Canibus is saying to his audience to ask questions be philosophical. The solar 25, to my knowledge, refers to the suns great conveyor belt which is at its slowest progression. The solar 25 will occur in 2022.\n\nFor a greater reference on this subject matter please read the following\n\n\n\nThis is the observation, that by the year 2025 of the new millennia, when the Kurzweilian Singularity occurs, some of us may not be a potential equation in the theory of life. Whether in the objective (as in space technologies) or subjective (as in astral projection) realms \u2013 ubermensch are mastering the force of gravity, and learning to fly into higher dimensions. A pagoda is a tower. The nurse is symbolic of a metaphor of Hip Hop. \u201cRobot arm\u201d is reference to a Doctor that is mindlessly following the system.\n\n\n\nDoctors and Nurses, the \u201cmindless\u201d shamans of our flawed medical system. Canibus is stating that he wont turn his back on his audience for cash payment. Early in Canibus\u2019s career he was known as having a scioentific style that contained punchlines. Canibus rarely uses punchlines now so this lyric is a reference to that. This is a statement about the problems of Capitalism He is stating to not trust the media. This view is also held by current day intellectual Noam Chomski Two possible enterpretations the literal one (needing no explanation) or it may be a reference to the book of the same title written by Grant Achatz. Canibus is anxious\n\n\n\nSuch immense divine love to experience, his heart tries bursting across dimensions. Canibus was born in Jamaica Paranormal is a reference to experiences that are beyond scientific explanation.\n\n\n\nCanibus is a paranormal researcher, and in this instance, he\u2019s being trapped in a sub-system filled with alternate realities \u2013 anti-matters and materials \u2013  a haunted place. This lyric is stating to have emmotions and think independantly the robot is a metaphor for being mentally static.\n\n\n\nShape-Shifting is essential. This is a reference to surviving the music industry which Canibus has had a complex relationship with. A Canibus reference that Hip Hop should not have connections to Capitalism.\n\n\n\n\n\nSeriously, Hip Hop is about using the spoken word, to both create and shape reality \u2013 our lives, society, the world in which one lives, and this has nothing to do with contracts, expensive shows, and the like. The most celebrated elite in Hip Hop are some of the more underground types, and these have demonstrated the ability to lead the culture despite working with little or no commercial appeal or motivations. The light is symbolic to Canibus\u2019s lyrics which represent in this context the truth. Ghosts moaning in the hell of hells: Canibus is stating that he is not a freemason.\n\n\n\nCanibus, is an African Shaman of the Supreme Mathematics. Canibus is stating that his purpose is not driven by pride.\n\nHe has to use such techniques as magick, to be able to push the Supreme Mathematics, into the hearts and minds of fellow African Elite.\n\nSo this is his way of contributing to a greater cause. Canibus is stating that you dont have to sacrifise your iintegrity to get an oppurtunity. Canibus is stating that the value of money is not the only currency in this world. So for example you can\u2019t buy a soul or knowledge or love or peace. Such things can only be attained via discipline, will-power, proper action, proper thinking, etc which money doesn\u2019t equate to. Airstrike is a reference to his eminem diss. Political statement Canibus raps not for himself but for Hip Hop. Canibus is talking to his audience stating that he is in isolation. He may be reffering to the fact that he writes his lyrics in this enviroment. One assumes that the word \u201cbraveheart\u201d means warrior as that is the represenattion of the film that it is referencing. \u201cThey\u201d is a symbolic reference to the Illuminati. It also makes sense to observe how the emergence of such black elite orders as the 5%ers, isn\u2019t taken lightly by the ruling, white elite (of which the Illuminati are a part). Quoting the hook from him and Rakim\u2019s collab\n\u201cI\u2019ll Buss' em, you punish em\u201d The pineal gland is related to the album concept of Melatonin.\n\nMCs, they get to become elite of their subjective universe, by shape-shifting across states, like Canibus has done.\n\nOpening of, activation of the PINEAL GLAND (also known as the \u201cThird Eye\u201d in esoteric literature) does make the mind capable of mystical and or magical feats like clairvoyance, astral projection, etc He\u2019s shedding light on the presence of the Illuminati. The Obama slogan \u201cYes We Can\u201d is \u201cThank You Satan\u201d when the audio is reversed. This lyric has the implication of conspiracy which focuses on Government lies. This is one of his aliases and the name of a song off The \u2018C\u2019 of Tranquility. He got the name from Hip Hop pioneers, Cold Crush Brothers. To my understanding the frontal lobe is the emmotional part of the brain that formns our character.\n\nand it is well known, character has been demonstrated by the theosophical elite, to be the actual essence of man.

Larry (Garry Shandling), a late night talk show host, is torn up over Duchovny\u2019s apparent homoerotic crush on him when he guests on the show. The whole point was to turn the Duchovny sex symbol myth on its head by making Duchovny himself the obsessive fan.\n\nThis bit was so popular that the Larry Sanders writers themselves parodied the bit in the series finale by setting up Sanders and Duchovny in a scene like the Basic Instinct interrogation \u2013 in another episode of the series, Larry Sanders dates Sharon Stone The joke of the song is who\u2019s the alien, the narrator for loving a celebrity, or the people who mock her for it?\n\nAlso an inside joke about viewers who dismissed The X-Files as a dumb sci-fi show (late in the series' run, Mulder is abducted, which finally causes Scully to \u201cbelieve\u201d) Weirdly, Californication seems to call back to this song when Duchovny\u2019s character Hank Moody loses his girl, maybe forever, as Elton John\u2019s \u201cRocket Man\u201d plays in the background Along the line of Lou Reed\u2019s \u201cSatellite of Love\u201d A paranoid, histrionic love like that Louise Labe expresses in the sonnet Je vis, je meurs\n\nOne translation:\n*I live, I die; I\u2019m on fire and I drown;\nI\u2019m freezing while I feel extremely hot;\nliving, to me, is too hard and too soft,\na bitter pill, with wine to wash it down.\n\nI simultaneously laugh and cry;\nI suffer many torments in my pleasure;\nmy happiness departs, yet lasts forever;\nmy leaves grow green and at the same time dry.\n\nThus fickle Eros flings me here and there:\njust when it seems I\u2019m sunk in tribulations,\nthey suddenly dissolve into thin air;\n\nand just as I\u2019m sure my joy has firm foundations\nand stretches to the heavens, that is when\nI\u2019m plunged back into misery again.* Ever notice how Drake is basically just doing brooding Duchovny in every single press photo?

He says that he is better than all of the people that they want to be. The mixtap \u201cTil Infinity\u201d is on. John Stockton and Karl Malone were superstar players for the Utah Jazz during the 1980\u2019s, 1990\u2019s, and early 2000\u2019s.  The two played together for nearly their whole careers, nearly winning the NBA Championship two different times.\n\n\n\nStockton retired in 2003, leaving Malone in the NBA alone in the NBA without Stockton for the first time.  Just as Stockton left Malone alone, Cole is going to leave wack rappers alone and not mess with them. Cole doesn\u2019t have any time to chill in his journey for success and he has to be grinding. This juxtaposes the essence of the original Souls of Mischief song, which is one of the most chill hip-hop songs ever. You\u2019re probably beefing with Cole cuz you want to be like him\n(Jealousy) Ur nowhere close to match J.Cole\u2019s bars Cole ain\u2019t gonna let the city\u2019s hate get in his way The city (New York) takes pride in hating on up and coming new artists. It is almost impossible to make it big in the Big Apple The way he raps will have any competitors feeling sad since they can\u2019t match up, not to mention he\u2019ll be dropping even more rhymes soon. Hes sayin He doesnt believe you when you say your shits hot. Hes playin on words when he says he doesn\u2019t \u201cBuy it(believe it)\u201d and that its not bought like its \u201cBoycotted\u201d (an organized movement to not buy, or not use a product/service; like the Montgomery Bus Boycott.) J cole\u2019s better than the rest so you should just rest aka sit down and stay in your place Cole is signed to roc nation, his crew\n\u201crock\u201d slang word for rap flow he has no time to be wasting around his trying to earn some big $$$ and build an empire\u2026 reference to to the batman\u2026.it seems like there is a crime going down in gotham city The quote goes: \u201cIf you can make it here (New York), you can make it anywhere\u201d A kid from Fayetville,NC that has always been sick at rhyming, and probably will never get a cure for it. Cole is saying that New York has no love for him.\n\nCole is referring to the city of New York.\n\nIn the concrete jungle, its either eat or be eaten. People do not care about a person\u2019s past, experiences or how far they\u2019ve grown up. Instead, people will only recognize you if you\u2019re able to compete with the big names in the industries.\n\nIn this line, Cole is showing love to this city because the type of competition he finds in the concrete jungle is forcing him to innovate, evolve, and compete. In essence, the city made him to be the big star that he is now. The Giants play in New Jersey, despite being called the New York Giants.\n\n\n\nThis line could also be a reference to how the San Francisco Giants used to play in New York before moving to California. Cole is saying that people are not buying your shit, but some dont seem to comprehend. He\u2019s Far from a scrub, but he mops the rappers that are considered as scrubs\n\nAlso a Play on words, a mop is a type of scrub but hes not a scrub but hell wipe the floor with niggas. He\u2019s saying he is not a thug, but he\u2019ll beat they ass Cole is trying to stand out like the bat sign of Batman in Gotham city The Warm Up is the title of the mixtape. Step to a nigga get 4 Times 2\n\n(Four Times Two= Eight: Ate)\nIn the streets, getting \u2018Ate\u2019 is a slang word for getting shot up\n\n4 times 2 also equals 8 knuckles to the face (two fists). Hes on a mission to be one of the greatest artists of all time and theres no questioning his motives.  So all the girls who wanna get with him and become his babies mama will never get the chance cause hes smarter than that. not letting these hoes have a get rich quick scheme He used have no money and now hes trying to go from a training bra to a few eye poppers(tons of money).\n\n\u201ctreasure chest and double d\u201d also can be a  reference to Dungeons & Dragons, thats why he says on a quest in the next line. Everyone who tries to rap wonders how to make it big and be living large. J Cole doesn\u2019t need to worry because hes been working at his craft for so long and puts so much into it.\n\nGiven how hard Cole has worked for the \u201cformula,\u201d he is not going to share it with other cats who are asking him. Elite, a former producer associated with QN5, is now a close friend with and producer of J. Cole.\n\n\n\nHe helped J. Cole produce songs on The Warm Up.

This one is quite complicated and he is all the more brilliant for it. Most architecture and design jobs require some sort of math skill (geometry, etc.) including the designing of factories (which give off smog)\n\nIntegrating the beginning of this sentence, CAL is an abbreviation for California (which has an issue with smog caused by industry) An anteater, as its name suggests, eats ants. Well, if a large ant came about and an anteater was nearby, that would be an ironic death for the anteater Bo is mostly just using a lot of words that start with \u201cpro\u201d, but he is basically saying that pro-life abortion is probably (ie. likely) a problem, and is instructing us to take the approximate moral proportion (the weight and importance of certain values) of the two sides of it \u2013 those who agree with and those who do not agree with abortion. The approximation is the estimation of those values in an individual who spouts pro-life (anti-abortion) values and yet is getting an abortion. Such a contradiction is likely due to an individual\u2019s contradictory moral code. In Massachusetts (where Bo is from), sex with any individual under the age of 16 is considered statutory rape, hence the lyrics, \u2018how many more months\u2019.  For all participants of the threesome to reach the age of consent, we have to look at Kim\u2019s age (being the youngest).\n\nThe phrase \u201c30-day months\u201d refers to giving a standard size to months; you\u2019re supposed to find the number of days and then divide it by 30 to get the amount of 30-day months.  It eliminates the issue of different months being different lengths.  So in a standard year, there are 12.17 30-day months.\n\nIf Tori is 12, then Bobby must be 14, and Kim is 7, so we have a range to consider since Bo didn\u2019t give us her birthdate:\n\nBest case scenario, she turns 8 tomorrow. She\u2019ll be 16 in eight years and one day.\n8x365+2 (leap years*) +1 (birthday tomorrow) = 2923 days\n2923/30 = 97.43 30-day months\n\nWorst case scenario is that today is her 7th birthday.  She\u2019ll be 16 in nine years.\n9x365+2 (leap years*) = 3287 days\n3287/30 = 109.57 30-day months\n\nThis makes the answer somewhere between 97.43 and 109.57 months.\n\n*Bo performed this song in 2008 (a leap year).  But, he performed it in June, which means there are two leap years for both the best and worst scenarios. Pi is used to find volume of round objects (cylinders, spheres, etc.), and since the man is fat, he is therefore round. In order to predict his volume change (i.e. how much his size increases), you need to know the value of pi, and in order to predict the amount of change he gets, you need to know the value of the pie he buys. \u201cFact, or\u201d sounds like \u201cfactor\u201d. It seems that Kennedy and Lincoln can be linked with many common factors:\n\nAbraham Lincoln was elected to Congress in 1846.\nJohn F. Kennedy was elected to Congress in 1946.\n\nAbraham Lincoln was elected President in 1860.\nJohn F. Kennedy was elected President in 1960.\n\nThe names Lincoln and Kennedy each contain seven letters.\n\nBoth Presidents were shot on a Friday.\n\nBoth were shot in the head.\n\nBoth were assassinated by Southerners.\n\nBoth were succeeded by Southerners.\n\nBoth successors were named Johnson.\n\nAndrew Johnson, who succeeded Lincoln, was born in 1808.\nLyndon Johnson, who succeeded Kennedy, was born in 1908.\n\nBoth assassins were known by their three names.\nBoth names are comprised of fifteen letters.\n\nBooth ran from the theater and was caught in a warehouse.\nOswald ran from a warehouse and was caught in a theater.\n\nBooth and Oswald were assassinated before their trials.\n\n(Please note that I\u2019ve taken out all of the controversial pieces and left just the facts that are true. For a break down of the \u201cconspiracy\u201d visit Snopes.) Lnx is generally written ln(x) and is called a natural log. So, the opposite of a natural log would be an unnatural log.\n\nIn this case, that would be a Duraflame log, which is a company that produces fake or unnatural logs that can be burned. A factor tree breaks down a number into all of its different components, in order to get to the simplest numbers that make up the original. In Bo\u2019s case, the factors are quite simple: Asian porn. The square root of a number is another number that can be multiplied by itself to find the original. For example, the square root of 16 is 4, because 4x4=16. In order to make Africa square, he has to put it in a box (which generally has a square shape).\n\nBasically, Bo is saying that at least half of the men who play in the NBA are black. A set is organized and similar data. Circumference is the measurement around the outside of a circular object. Like a ball\u2026or your penis\u2026 Quadratic expansion is a mathematical term for breaking down problems into a more simplified manner. If the pieces of the problem can no longer be split into simpler terms, it is time to stop, and you have your answer.\n\nIn terms of sex, if a woman\u2019s legs cannot be split (ie. opened, accessed) then it is also time to stop trying. (And you have your answer: \u201cNo means no!\u201d) An example of an improper fraction is 7/4, which should be broken down into a proper fraction: 1 \u00be. Just like having sex, it is improper for the larger person/number to be on top. (Not to mention painful!) So, it should be broken down into a proper fraction, which, in relation to sex would be like\u2026.a threesome? To square a number, you just multiply that number by itself. When they are low (under 13) you can mostly just do them in your head. Although Bo mentions to only \u201cdo\u201d girls under 13 in your head, I\u2019d recommend sticking with the number \u201c17\u201d. Can anyone say jail bait? a pirate looks rough and wears torn clothes and has bad teeth etc, just like a homeless guy. so without his ship he is just a homeless guy trying to look like a pirate 2%. In some Asian countries (notably Japan, rather than China, contrary to Bo\u2019s rhyme), people often eat kneeling on pillows. While giving a blowjob, a gay man would often end up doing so from his knees. Basically, Bo is asking what percent of men are gay Chinese men. Farmers use tractors, geometers use protractors. Farming supporters are \u201cpro-tractors\u201d. \u201ci\u201d is an imaginary number. If you multiply two imaginary numbers together, they become real.\n\nSince we all known Santa Clause isn\u2019t real (he\u2019s imaginary), if you multiply him by \u201ci\u201d you\u2019ve got yourself Kris Kringle in the flesh. Nike, and many other large companies, hire workers overseas for cheap labor. Workers are often vastly underpaid, meaning their meals would be one-fifth of a bag of chips. he has sex best with himself (masterbation) conductor is another name for a train driver, and is also a name given to a material that conducts electricity CAL-C-U-LATER (calculator) a scatter plot is a graph that measure many different things that are represented by one dot, there is usually up to 20 dots on one page. to find the average you need to follow the dots which can be spread randomly. Tracing requires the drawing of erratic and random lines. Parkinson\u2019s, which Fox has, is a disease that cause erratic and random movement. In terms of mathematics, \u201cdomain\u201d represents the letter X. \u201cRange\u201d represents the letter Y.\n\nXXY is also called Klinefelter\u2019s Syndrome in which a male (who usually has an XY chomosome) has an extra X chromosome, represented as XXY. One would think that the combination of XX and XY in the XXY chromosome would result in both feminine and masculine sex organs. Bo is suggesting (by saying he has too much in his pants) that he is a hermaphrodite, but that\u2019s not actually the case. In fact, XXY males usually have small testicles, but do in fact have some feminine features (more breast tissue, for example). Lance Armstrong was a professional road racing cyclist who has survived testiclar cancer. At the time this song was written, Lance had won 6 titles at the Tour de France race.  He went on to actually win a 7th title.  However, he admitted to taking performance enhancing drugs and has been stripped of all awards/accomplishments and has been banned from competing in the sport again.

In the song she talks about keeping a positive attitude in the midst of all one\u2019s haters.\n\n\u201cCold War\u201d segues seamlessly into \u201cTightrope\u201d and together they form one longer piece that discuss both the negative and positive aspects of being trailblazers (which applies to the character of Cyndi Mayweather but definitely has real-world implications as well). She\u2019s gonna keep her balance, no matter what. Janelle is saying she is different compared to other artists in both lyrics and meaning than what is currently \u201con the scene\u201d People try to tear you down but you won\u2019t let them If you\u2019re not prepared to follow her policies, you can get lost Monae and Big Boi already collaborated together on the OutKast song Call The Law and Boig Boi`s song In Your Dreams. If you go to extremes, you\u2019ll end up falling down the ladder of success. You have to keep your balance, like Janelle! Regardless of how she feels, or perhaps her current position on the fame tightrope, she\u2019s going to keep doing what she does best.\n\nJanelle has always had a unique sound and style when it comes to her craft. Never being afraid to do what comes naturally to her. Some say she\u2019s bad, some say she\u2019s the best, but whatever they say, she\u2019s callin' all y'all accountable for it. Like calling them \u201cfor church\u201d\u2026 She is active in fighting for what she wants. You just wanna talk about fighting for it. It\u2019s hard to stay level-headed, but Big Boi stays careful with his weapons. Strap is a euphemism for a gun, and refers to the holster that secures it under clothing. She\u2019s talking about the machine, the system \u2013 people should know the truth of how things work \u2013 but she won\u2019t complain about it, because she\u2019s good enough to succeed in spite of the difficulties. She\u2019s talking directly to the listener \u2013 who has the option to keep blaming the system for their shortcomings, instead of taking responsibility like she does.  Folding is to back out of a hand in the game poker \u2013 he\u2019ll make you back down. MacBooks also fold closed; clever wordplay.\n\nThe reference to a \u201cMacBook\u201d here is also a reference to privilege and elitism, implying that it is wealthier people who are standing in the way. \u201cCabbage\u201d = head\n\n\n\nMaybe Big Boi is a Kids in the Hall fan.  Seems like a guy who would appreciate Canadian sketch comedy\u2026 Another of Big Boi\u2019s nicknames Classic film stars exhibit grace and poise, qualities that one ought to emulate.\n\nFurthermore, Mon\u00e1e\u2019s artistic output reveals a great love for cinema. Most notably, her \u201cArchAndroid\u201d persona is modeled after the robot \u201cstar\u201d of the 1927 film Metropolis: Mon\u00e1e is highlighting the metaphorical nature of the \u201ctightrope\u201d: it\u2019s life itself. Your choice is always whether to follow others or make your own path. She isn\u2019t just walking on the tightrope, let alone avoiding it \u2013 she\u2019s dancing on it, showing her confidence. It\u2019s a belief and a move. So understand, then dance! His or her actions speak loudly and the haters are responding. They are trying to bring this person down and Janelle is encouraging him/her to keep going. Somebody clearly has some haters. Janelle is explaining how they treat this somebody. Music is medicine! She\u2019s talking to the brass section Terminators (as seen in the famous film series) are singularly focused and dedicated to the task with which they are programmed. Mon\u00e1e is firmly focused in her musical mindset/direction\n\n\n\nACCEPTED COMMENT: Ms Monae frequently refers to androids in her work; this is in keeping with her regular themes. Thongs tend to ride up, ya dig? Alligators and rattlesnakes both make loud hissing noises when the feel threatened (the gators use their vocal cords, while the snakes use the dead, hollow skin rattle on their tales). Regardless, it\u2019s a rather clever metaphor for all of Mon\u00e1e\u2019s haters, who make all this noise because they\u2019re intimidated by her talent and poise. make it funky Continuing to walk straight in spite of haters. No matter how much hate, gossip or flat-out lies are spewed about you, keep your cool lest you fall into a publicity nightmare.\n\nJust ask Britney Spears, Mel Gibson, Lindsay Lohan, etc. Since the start of the 2008 recessions, the stock exchange rates (like the Dow Jones and NASDAQ) have been plummeting, but Big Boi is certain that they will \u201cget back up\u201d and that the economy will get better. Big Boi is one optimistic rapper\u2026 Matchbooks contain a strip of material with a high friction coefficient; when matchheads are struck across it, the frictional force produces heat and ignites the match head. Sir Lucious Leftfoot, a.k.a. Big Boi from Outkast. http://youtu.be/k4AE7r51Dqc Metropolis is a 1927 film which Cindi Mayweather\u2019s style clearly draws upon. However, whereas the robot in the original film is a bad guy, in Janelle Monae\u2019s retelling of the story, the android Cindi becomes the hero.\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSExdX0tds4 \u201cUkulele Lady\u201d is a popular standard, an old evergreen song by Gus Kahn and Richard A. Whiting. Published in 1925, the song was first made famous by Vaughn De Leath.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cAE6TVc-EF0 To Equivocate: to use ambiguous language so as to conceal the truth or to avoid committing oneself.\n\nTo be a successful tightrope walker, one must be totally committed to the task in hand. And that is the commitment demonstrated by Monae\u2019s inspiration, Philippe Petit, the Man On Wire who achieved the impossible task of illegally tightroping between the twin towers of the World Trade Centre.\n\nhttp://youtu.be/fVLLBDlVUYg They talk about you doin' your thing cuz they cant do it!

He was a junior in High School at this time. Mac would stay up all night making music and then he would have to go to school during the day so he would get no sleep. His motive is the money.

Johnson was the first African-American Heavyweight Boxing Champion in history. He faced harsh legal repercussions and persecution for not accepting the racist customs of the time. He even openly partnered white women in a time where interracial relations were extremely taboo. He was his own man, he called his own shots, and he refused to take orders from anybody! Jack was well known for taunting his overmatched opponents. Often times he would be so bored in dominating his fights, he would carry on conversations with ringside spectators and hecklers\u2026 during the fight! That\u2019s a whole new level of trash talk! Jack was arguably the most well-known African-American of his time. He was seen as a larger-than-life hero to his people, and the worst of villains to the white establishment. His triumphs in the boxing ring led to riots and sometimes even the maiming or murders of innocent black people in a time of severe racial inequality. Jack Johnson reigned as the Heavyweight Champion of the World from 1908-1915. Jack was famous for his flashy gold teeth. Jack Johnson was one of the most dominant fighters of his era. He amassed an impressive 73 wins in his illustrious career, with 40 of those wins coming by knockout. He is pictured here flooring Jim Jeffries in the \u201cBattle of the Century,\u201d on July 4th, 1910. Jack Johnson was known for his sense of fashion and his love of fast cars. Legend has it that Jack was once stopped for speeding and was cited for a $50 ticket; he paid the policeman $100 and said that he would drive the same speed on his return journey. What a boss! Jack \u201cworks the bag\u201d, meaning he trains with the heavy and speed bags to become the best boxer he can. His hard work paid off as he is regarded as one of the greatest boxers in history. This is a drum beat, and represents the perfection (and percussion) of Blues music. No matter what, the deal is that Black Jack will always come and \u201cknock em down\u201d, or be on top. what has been said so far is the truth What you build up, Black Jack was able to throw down and mess up. \u201cBlack Jack\u201d was a very powerful man.

Rowdy Rod Piper\n\n\n\n\u201cI was getting 3 million dollars and spendin' 4\u201d You ever seen that scene in American Me where he fucks the girl in the ass like he was in the clink?\n\nWhen a man gains freedom from an all male setting where celibacy competes with homosexual rape, the prospect of sex with women is susceptible to overindulgence The oxy-moron is part of the over-inflated hyperbole. He has such a knack with the opposite sex, he has the ability to smack women with small cup-sizes that work in a restaurant famed for hiring women with large breasts. These clubs are filled with guttersnipes.\nWhen you don\u2019t clean your tub, they get rings where the grime that floats on the top of the water settles around the porcelain. Large spinning rims were very popular in 2003, especially in the South. A magnificent punchline (if I do say so myself), Ludacris shows off his affluence by putting these rims on his rollerskates or the trucks of his skateboard. Luda\u2019s so great that he compares himself to the Great Lakes, a collection of freshwater lakes in northeaster North America. The five Great Lakes consist of Lakes Superior, Michigan, Huron, Erie, & Ontario. The term \u201cbreak a leg\u201d was made to combat the use of \u201cgood luck\u201d at stage shows as it was seen as \u201cbad luck\u201d\n\nAn American Football linebacker, Lawrence Taylor is infamous for both ruthlessness on the Football field and he once broke Joe Theisman\u2019s leg in an infamous sack during the 80s.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7acc6qwcmQ Imagine him on the lot of the \u201cArea Codes\u201d or \u201cRollout\u201d video. As Hype Williams shouts cut, he goes back to his trailer and receives oral sex from a video vixen. In his episode of Cribs, he showed of how his fridge was stocked with nothing but chicken and beer, showing that he truly does live that lifestyle.\n\n\n\nNote: Luda\u2019s album after Word of Mouf was named Chicken-n-Beer.

This song is the one for Vaudeville Villain. For other albums:\n\n\n\n\nalbum\nyear\nsong\n\n\n\n\nVaudeville Villain\n2004\nLet Me Watch\n\n\nMadvillainy\n2004\nEye\n\n\nMM..

So if they started dating, most likely it wouldn\u2019t have ended well. More than once Nikki\u2019s mother has come home and she\u2019s had to hang up on Vik quickly in mid-sentence to keep their relationship a secret. Even though she is angry and no longer wants to see Vik, he\u2019s stilled convinced that he\u2019s gonna \u201clong stroke it\u201d.  Mike cheated on Nikki with her best friend and got her pregnant, and he still wants to get with Nikki after that. It\u2019s their first date. They\u2019re doing what most people would on a first date talk about themselves, walk together, and they split a drink together, how sweet. Typical that the family doesn\u2019t want a villain around their daughter. But Nikki wants to prove to her mom and everyone that they\u2019re wrong and Vik is a nice guy Shes so in love she thinks about him before bed and fantasizes them being together Nikki likes Vik so much she\u2019s practicing what to say to him next time she sees him A hickie is a mark left from when someone kisses/sucks on your skin for too long causing a reddish mark to appear. Not something you want people to see. Viktor fell in love with Nikki the first time he saw her Come on Vik don\u2019t you know it\u2019s impolite to be late for a date? #Uh oh\u2026 I think she\u2019s falling in love!\n\nNikki is currently dreaming of the perfect relationship she could have with Viktor. She stutters, she thinks about him all day, she feels short of breath\u2026\n\nDAMMNNNN\n\n\n\nHer fantasies of teen love (something most teenage girls seem to have, as evidenced by most of their Tumblr  blogs) could\u2019ve come to fruition, if Vik didn\u2019t have other plans\u2026 She took the initiative, showing interest, but left the decision to him. Viktor Vaughn is one of Doom\u2019s more youthful personas, who used to act older than he really was. She\u2019s fed up with all the men in her life.\n\nThis may or may not be a play on then-phenom Michael Vick, who had the sports world amazed at the time when Vaudeville Villain was made. She has just told Viktor something about herself, now in return she wants to know more about him It refers to the original sin and how we find things that are bad for us attractive. Vik thinks she\u2019ll just forget about what he said at the end of his previous verse and still go to his place. Refers to Dutch Masters, brand of naturally wrapped Cigars. Mo\u00ebt & Chandon is a French winery and one of world\u2019s largest Champagne producers. High end stuff. She got off Prozac three weeks ago (after dealing with Mike, presumably a few months before that) but is so pissed off at Vik that she\u2019s flipping out (and might have to get back on her meds) They do this every day, talk for hours on the phone till someone or something gets in to interrupt. Most genius part of the song. The importance here is that when making Music DOOM is much more focussed on the progress and quality of his songs over how he is viewed in the media as a famous icon. He is not interested in being viewed as cool, rich, having all the women, but he is proud of his Musical abilities. This song expresses that he truly does not give a fuck about the other things Rappers mostly aim for. If anything, he is advertising people not wanting to \u2018fuck with him\u2019 as an OK thing in his mind. Monumental respect for the man. Sometimes people getting to know each other first works best, but can be frustrating for a man wanting to get laid not knowing where he stands. He is male, after all. She lets it slide, maybe even somewhat likes the attention. That great feeling when man and woman are talking and do the whole \u2018me 2\u2019 in agreement with each other\u2019s tastes for the first time. We\u2019ve all been there. She\u2019d like her mother to calm down and give her freedom, thinking maybe drugs will help, but then expresses that she has given up and knows her mother is concerned for the correct reasons. Teasing remark concerning all that he has in store for her when he see\u2019s her. She is surprised that he would treat her like someone he doesn\u2019t care for.\n\nPigeon could be an Homage to Sporty Thievz \u2013 \u201cNo Pigeons\u201d Late night drink. Viktor was sporting a full denim outfit. She was checking out Vik to see if he\u2019s the right one Even though Nikki doesn\u2019t want to be around him anymore, Viktor is still tryna do her. Vik is a much younger character than DOOM. He is implied to be in his teens but often displays the mindset and behaviours of a much older person. Dating a girl who still has a curfew could seem jarring but may well be perfectly normal for someone of Vik\u2019s age. She stays in shape. Looks like Vik found himself a hot date. Viktor Vaughn: a smooth suave gangster. (BTW: \u2018stee\u2019 means style) He\u2019s about to get laid and he\u2019s like, \u201cFinally! I am ready to throw down the money and shit. Let\u2019s get this thing going\u201d. The scent of Nikki and Vik\u2019s perfumes are in the air.\n\nSamsara is a women\u2019s perfume by Guerlain; Fahrenheit is a popular men\u2019s perfum by Christian Dior. A short version of \u2018Viktor\u2019, the alias Daniel Dumile aka MF Doom has assumed for this record. She like\u2019s him so far but doesn\u2019t quiet trust him yet. The eyes are gateways into the soul, as we find out later. He\u2019s gonna lose interest in her if she doesn\u2019t open her legs soon. Vik wasn\u2019t acting too thirsty, like was trying to keep it on the low that he fell in love with her so he doesn\u2019t seem weird or desperate She has a name chain with a herringbone cord\nName chain:\n\n\n\nHerrinbone cord: She has such a cute smile. Both a flower and the name of the ship which brought the pilgrims to Plymouth Rock.\n\nHe most likely means the flower. Diamond chips are real diamonds, but as the name implies, they are usually small and lack the full diamond shape. This makes them much cheaper when compared to the fully faceted stones.\n\nThe crips are a famous gang based in Los Angeles, with ties to rappers such as Snoop Dogg, Ice-T, and Eazy-E. They are known for wearing the color blue.\n\nSo she\u2019s wearing something like this along with a matching bracelet Vik\u2019s gonna get laiddddddd!!!\n\nTheir very different perspectives on their relationship show here. Nikki\u2019s has fallen deeply in love with Vik. He\u2019s her first love and she has started to romanticise everything about them. Having sex with Vik will be be a huge step to her that she has never taken before and is very nervous about.\n\nVik on the other hand is just irritated that he hasn\u2019t got Nikki into bed yet and is perfectly willing to cut her off abruptly if he has to wait much longer. She was wearing a K-Swiss branded tracksuit A reference to The Notorious B.I.G.. Also, she can be heard singing along to the Biggie song \u201cParty and Bullshit\u201d in the background. The song was his debut single and released in 1993, hence \u201cvintage\u201d. Vik is wondering if Nikki has ever had oral sex performed on her. Bring a change of clothes just in case they have sex. He gets an erection just by talking to her on the phone. Heaven has no rage like love to hatred turned, Nor hell a fury like a woman scorned\n\nWilliam Congreve, The Mourning Bride (1697)\n\nUsually paraphrased as \u201cHell hath no fury like a woman scorned\u201d\n\nVik called Nikki a \u201cho\u201d in the previous line and she is a bit shocked and surprised cuz she liked him, but now she is now hella pissed off and wants to slap him in the face and tell Vik to fuck off and that she does not want to get with him anymore. Babies breast feed, so they get to suck on titties, but then Vik calls her a ho\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how he meant it, but either way Nikki\u2019s not having it. The very talented and underrated Apani B is rapping as the character in the song, named Nikki. He is making up stories about him knowing and having connections to famous people trying to impress Nikki. Vik is trying to diffuse the situation by admitting he talks and jokes around without thinking. The title of the song and also the final reflection of Viktor\u2019s moral character. He cares more about how turned on he is by the act of her masturbating than the implications of her words, meaning he just cared about the sex and not her.\nBrilliant. A rather crude way of both stating that she would rather fuck herself then get fucked over by Viktor Vaughn and that she would never consider having sex (fucking) him. In other words, she is really mad at him and doesn\u2019t want anything to do with him. Prozac is prescription anti-depressant drug.\n\nConsidering Nikki just conflated Vik having jokingly called her a \u201cho\u201d with her ex who cheated on her with her best friend whom he got pregnant, it\u2019s clear she has some issues. She doesn\u2019t want to be referred to in derogatory terms Viktor Vaughn never had to put up with waiting to long and getting to know one another before having sex. \u201cVet\u201d meaning veteran. Viktor Vaughn\u2019s mind is wondering what the potential of this meeting could be, and refers to lovers that often describe their relation as \u2018meant to be\u2019.\n\nEither that or Vaughn is being pragmatic. Whether the outcome is good or bad, he\u2019ll chalk it up to fate. She heard he was the kind of guy who is romantic but also has some roguish (gangsta) aspects to him.\n\nDumile\u2019s first group, K.M.D., started out as a graffiti crew. A girl sees Viktor Vaughn on television and wants to meet him, seeking a potential relationship, through a distant connection. Vik\u2019s tone suggests he is both pleased with and intrigued by this prospect. Viktor Vaughn is a character and persona MF Doom often assumes, even as far as releasing entire albums under the name of Viktor Vaughn, a fictitious cocky and morally questionable rapstar.\n\nMF Doom\u2019s name is inspired by the comic book villain Doctor Doom.\n\n\n\nMF Doom\u2019s alias on this song continues this theme as Doctor Doom\u2019s alter ego in the comics is named Victor von Doom.

This track, as with every track on the album, was produced by beat extraordinaire, Blueprint who is know for his frequent collaborations with the underground legend, Aesop Rock, and his dense, challenging style.\n\nLike most of Illogic\u2019s releases, he recieved no mainstream recognition for his album. Still, the title track remains one of his most mesmerizing and well-loved songs among those who follow him. What he perceives at paradise isn\u2019t \u201cnormal\u201d to most people continuing the pirate metaphor, he pushes offenders off the plank into the ocean. If you are unable to continue to produce the same quality of what many old-school rap artists founded for hip-hop, and insist on continuing to disenfranchise the genre with \u201cnew age hip-hop\u201d, that might be a pale imitation of hip-hop\u2019s past glory, then end your musical careers, because you are damaging a sacred form of music.\n\nAll good music must be an innovation\n -Les Baxter Illogic can\u2019t stand the mainstream rap we\u2019re being flooded with. We over-value insignificant things. With their mouths wrapped around a silver spoon, in other words; a gratuitous luxury. Illogic isn\u2019t referring to a life of constant death in the fashion one would expect of a hard life where people are being killed, but rather a life where one is always racing against the finite clock that is counting down to your death. Illogic is verbosely playing with the term \u201cdig your own grave\u201d talk about establishing the listener\u2019s faith in Illogic\u2019s often preachy but always introspective and beautiful verses. This song, while touching upon many themes, is largely about self-realization, and the individual is already at odds with the rest of society. Illogic is basically stating in a very eloquent and pretty fashion, that even though children thrive in the light, they will avoid it at all costs. What he means by this is up for interpretation, although one possibility is that it is a statement on how we escape from our potential because we are conditioned to be frightened of it. Illogic is talking about the evolution of things becoming perceived over time as far lager than they actually were. A glacier melts into the ocean much like a icon or hero over time becomes considered a god and the devil\u2019s spawn grows into Satan himself. We often ask big questions, but are afraid of what the answers might be. So if we are scared of the reality we should willfully remain ignorant. Becoming docile in pool of harsh reality will ironically come back to spite you (struck twice by lightning) which will reignite the fiery passion that once caused uproar initially. If celestial clockwork is an elixir, but the concept behind celestial clockwork has become simplified, than the idea has become tainted and impure. A concept as vague and far reaching and beyond our mental grasp such as the inner mechanics of the universe brings obscurity to a new level. However the more obscure something is the more simplistic it becomes, which is also an allegory to how his music is received and what it means to him. A celestial clock is an interesting device, an old astronomical clock that measures things such as the rotation around the sun and movement of the moon and other nifty things regarding the solar system and other astrological things. Check out this artistic rendering\n\n\n\nNow clockwork refers to the inside mechanics of a clock, in this case, a celestial clock, so Illogic is using it as a metaphor (that word comes up a lot with him) for inner mechanics of the universe which can be ingratiating and purifying for Illogic at the same time, nevertheless he considers it his \u201celixir.\u201d Illogic will continue to make these raps, which are far more out there than almost anything even close to what is considered mainstream, until he completely fades away and is forgotten. (Which hopefully won\u2019t be the case and he deserves a larger fanbase and more recognition more than most other underground or alternative rappers.) He\u2019s referring to people treasuring even the signature of some celebrity with closed lips for no reason, they haven\u2019t found their own path. AKA signature\nOr as Illogic would consider it, a false affirmation of individuality Individuality is becoming increasingly scarce, as if conjoint twins\n\n\n\n can show more independence from one another than the rest of society, we have a problem. Due to the cerebral and abstract flow of Illogic\u2019s rhymes it is not always possible to deduce a concrete meaning from his lyrics, and any meaning is highly subject to the individual listener\u2019s interpretation. That being said, Illogic could possibly be talking about an instance when the notion of good and right is instilled, it will instinctively scare off those who are already immune to pleasantries such as a righteous moral code. Annointing is a religious act of smearing oil, or other substances like melted butter or perfume over something, so as to cleanse someone or something of demons or dangerous influences. By claiming he has \u201cthe given gift of annointing,\u201d he is claiming that he can strip away all the bullshit to find truth. Immersed in hip-hop for as long as he could remember, Illogic is unsure if the genre\u2019s integrity will outlive him. Illogic\u2019s sights are set clear with his pioneering vision. Interestingly enough, in this line Illogic stated the thematic structure of this song itself. It starts off with the metaphor of his voyage, his realizations upon this journey, and the conclusions he draws from this at the end of the song. Illogic\u2019s path to self-realization cannot be followed by others Time is only kind if time never runs out. While objectively we are safe in that matter, but subjectively all of our timelines have an end. An interesting analogy. What if people are like fish in a pond and they way fish are oblivious to our thought process or purpose we are oblivious to whatever is above us?\n\nPeople do not bother analyzing and searching for deeper meaning, and therefore are ignorant of the hidden blessings and the reason why Illogic does what he does, in hip-hop and in life. This is a sample of dialogue from the movie entitled \u201cCelestial Clockwork,\u201d the same name of this song, and the album from which this song is from, as well. The movie came out in the nineties and was little seen by american audiences as the movie was made in Venezuela. This is deliberately ironic as a snake rolling over will leave it still on its front side. A lose-lose situation. He keeps with the treasure map allegory, using pirate imagery When we become lost we begin to seek some form of direction and guidance whether it exists or not, such as religion, or a metaphorical treasure map that will somehow lead us to prosperity. A thorough bred horse, usually bred for racing or sale, runs around aimlessly in a stable. Illogic is commenting on how we become lost in the daily humdrum of life, likening us to the horses. Babies that have died in the womb (still borns) have the significance of mere action figures or dolls when their numbers are high (stacked in a cradle).\n\nAll of this is a description of the life we take on when we enter the fast pace of modern civilization. As the population increases, and there and more people waiting to replace you, humans become more like bees, and life itself has less meaning. A looking glass is a term for a mirror. Illogic is saying that its hard to have true self-reflection and an open minded world view when you are pushed into a label.\n\nLabel has two meanings:\n\n\nA typecast or stereotype.\nA mainstream hip-hop label, as that would prevent him from making the music he wants to make. Literal interpretation: He watches the daylight evolve into the night sky upon the horizon.\n\nContextual significance: He observes the world and sees how it  works. The following few lines talk about his opinion on what he saw. Illogic\u2019s perspective, and by extension his music, is caught between the avant-garde and the underground. Illogic claims his life consists of accursed aspirations that accounts for his more abstract, commercial-unfriendly, music. He possibly references gumball machines as the tantalizing prospects that life, and his music has offered him.

I was the one who hurt you \u2026 and I\u2019m sorry. He is hurt and unable to finish what he was saying due to the emotional toll it is taking on him. Since the lion in Wizard of Oz is cowardly, it\u2019s a bit of an ironic message saying although you are not corageous at all, take the little bit that you have, if any, and get ready to invest it. As a side note, this line makes for a great Precision F Strike. By this point in your life you\u2019re just going through the motions; heartbreak after heartbreak, if you will. And yet, the idea of it all still scares you to death. Everything about you has fallen to pieces, yet your audacity remains intact. Maybe even undeservedly so. This line could take a few paragraphs to fully dissect, but for the sake of time let\u2019s keep it short; it basically boils down to \u201cpretty on the outside, not within.\u201d Despite what\u2019s gone on, it\u2019s best to just let things go.  You can\u2019t win every fight, but being a bigger man and walking away does not signify defeat. I was the one who made you who you are today, the games I played were detrimental to your well being\u2026 \u2026And this is my apology, I was blind before but now I see type deal. I\u2019m sorry for what I\u2019ve done. I really made a mess of things didn\u2019t I? Your remaining energy has been spent on problems that don\u2019t really matter\u2026 rather than building yourself up you\u2019ve wasted your time digging yourself deeper into a hole. Putting limits on yourself based on a cynical self-image.\n\nThis song was first realeased on the Love Your Ground EP and there the lyrics went \u201crate yourself and rape yourself\u201d. This was later changed, by one letter, to \u201crate,\u201d to avoid offense. This is a pretty complex metaphor that accompanies the \u201cLittle Lion Man\u201d one. As we know, a mother lion will carry her cub by the neck when he is young.  If you don\u2019t learn from your mother, you will be forever doomed to think of yourself as a child and even act like one. It\u2019s okay to cry manly tears Back at the beginning, you saw the world as a more ideal place, but his growing cynicism has caused his courage and faith to wane. The speaker is comparing you to a lion as a device to convey your current identity crisis; you desire to be grown and independent (hence the \u201clion man\u201d), but still feel like a helpless cub (\u201clittle lion\u201d.)\n\nIt could also be a reference to the Cowardly Lion in the Wizard of Oz. Despite the absolute and idyllic aspirations you hold inside yourself, it is impossible to truly become what you desire to be.

He also makes a play on words:\nImage, as in the look or persona a celebrity has to have will change if they sellout, but is also referring to the type of image that will be reflected when they look in the mirror. Pharrell gets a lot of haters sometimes, so when he takes a break from rapping and singing for a while, his fans would be weirded out like \u201cWhy doesn\u2019t he just make a new song?\u201d Pharrell is known not to be limited or bounded by anything, especially in the music industry.

This hater needs to take a step back.\n\nAlso, Pharrell also has a song called Frontin'. The music video can be seen here. Another sexual innuendo for \u201ccoming.\u201d Like a gun.  Sunrise\n\n\n\nHowever, the Sun does also set. There seems to be a lot of movie references throughout this song. I believe this is the fifth. This is quite the impressive play on words. Pharrell says the word \u201cForsaten\u201d instead of \u201cForsaken,\u201d intentionally causing it to sound like \u201cfor Satan.\u201d\n\nLooking up to God and asking why you\u2019ve been forsaken, is wondering why God has abandoned you. Asking why you\u2019ve been \u201cfor Satan,\u201d is an entirely different thing\u2026. This is a sexual innuendo. In this case, \u201cposition\u201d means sex position, and \u201ccoming\u201d means \u201cto orgasm.\u201d Pro Tools is a Audio and MIDI recording software by Avid. With King Kong feet, you could squish some pretty big shit. A reference to the mention of Twilight in the previous line. Twilight is about vampires, and vampires do indeed like blood\u2026  The famous book by Dan Brown, made into a movie directed by Ron Howard. A murder leads into a complicated religious mystery inside the Louvre in France. In this context, Pharrell is making a reference to the previous line, \u201cYou can\u2019t put me in a box.\u201d The Da Vinci code, as well as Twilight are both very popular, and he doesn\u2019t want to be categorized in the same way (though in that sense this is probably directed more towards Twilight).

Featuring his crew homies, The Outlawz, Pac delivers another blow to the world\u2019s richest and most powerful, a.k.a. the 1%. He knew that Illuminati will him kill him. People who used to live on his block have died and moved on as well as been arrested, with their absence his block doesent feel the same and he feels it as has suffered loss there for its dying They are ignoring all that appeals, looking at them with disgust. He may underline the character of Blacks with using the words such as   shottie,rowdy. Hearing the illuminati and the cases he deals with does effect the party moods he and blacks in If he\u2019s in a closed casket If this shit keeps on happening the streets are gonna be filled with blood, and the aftermath is the black youth The Media has us thinking the world is at peace, the government has us thinking the world is at peace, the rich have us thinking the world is at peace, but Napoleon\u2019s friend are dead for trying to live life. Most, if not all, 2Pac albums touch on the rights of African Americans and so what he\u2019s saying is: HEY! I already told you, now HELP US because we need help! PERHAPS, saying that most people have a family of five (Kids, mom, dad etc) and that he has to feed them tho they are not appreciated . Interesting double meaning line, he says that thug African Americans die often in the streets and in their daily lives, but the thug gangster community is doubling in people, and this speaks to Kadafi, saying that there are too many gangsters coming up in the game with guns. A highly intelligent lyric line speaking to how rappers or people born into this circumstance are born to a thug life of shootings and drugs (thuggish shit). This may also mean that they were born dope and thug so they are into the thug game with their lifestyles. He\u2019s watching the Black Communities of America die because of killings due to ethnicity. Pac says that he was asking for help for his fellow African-Americans, because they really are trying to get out of the hood and succeed, but because of the hate and racism, they are not even given a chance to prove themselves. Some people just want to get rich because they can\u2019t live poor, and they want to have financial freedom, not live of food stamps, and government \u201cdonations\u201d, but others don\u2019t see it, and they simply think that you want money because you are greedy. People say that African Americans are stupid (hard headed) because they love to hustle. He says that because others don\u2019t give a fuck, there is simply no reason for him to give a fuck. Only his homies care about him, but other people simply don\u2019t give a fuck. Kastro\u2019s homies are so loyal to him, that they can catch a bullet to save him. He acknowledges that it can end badly for them but know it\u2019s all because of love. If you just look at the big picture, you\u2019ll notice how the youth are being corrupted. What Tupac means by this is that you\u2019re going to snap and just go crazy because society treats you with ignorance and no respect. You\u2019re just seen as a waste of space that\u2019s hated by racist whites. \u201cSame Song\u201d was a 1991 Digital Underground track featuring 2pac\u2019s first vocal appearance on a record. Kastro is saying that from the beginning of 2pac\u2019s career until post-mortem, \u201cthey\u201d; the world, the media, the man, white society, America\u2019s power structure \u2013 have never and will never give a fuck about us. The entire image of inferiority is an illusion to keep us under control. If we were truly inferior then they wouldn\u2019t fear us; Pac is explaining that we have much more power than we think and we need to use it. THUG LIFE forever. It\u2019s possible that here, 2Pac is commenting on his own widespread popularity and fame. It\u2019s pretty common to see a lot of 2Pac memorabilia even these days, but 2Pac is saying that people only care about the struggles of African-Americans when people like him bring it to light. However, on a normal basis, it\u2019s ignored in mainstream media, and if it is brought up, it\u2019s portrayed in an antagonizing way.\n\n2Pac may also be speaking about black celebrities in general; notable African-Americans are revered in American society yet little has been done to improve the status of African-Americans. Power players work to trap young black men and women within the prison industrial complex. Tupac releases shots (from either his gun or his mouth) to make the people in society stop and see the bigger picture, similar to how fights are broken up with a warning shot. In the line, Tupac is referring to the many people who say that the black community can change, but aren\u2019t doing anything to help. Actions speak louder than words. Kadafi is saying that there is no point in being employed and working in this system \u2013 so therefore he chooses to live his life the way he wants it without caring what the public thinks. A reference to the song \u201cHow Long Will They Mourn Me\u201d by Tupac and his former group, Thug Life. Saying to white people: don\u2019t beg for mercy, when you granted us no mercy. When you look into a mirror you are supposed to see a true reflection of yourself. However, due to the way in which history has been taught and, due to the common narrative being pushed, we now look in \u2018mirrors\u2019 and see, not our true selves, but a picture of what our environment makes us look like. This is a reference to the previous statement about the Illuminati. Conspiracy theories of a New World Order taking over the world and \u201ceveryone being chipped\u201d. But he can\u2019t worry about that because he has a lot more on his mind right now.\n\n\n\nPac was very much ahead of his time Pac is saying that people should worry about real life issues, such as like close friends going crazy (\u201cbrothas flipping\u201d) rather than focusing on unrealistic conspiracy theories. 2Pac tells us to step back and look at the whole shape, because only then you can see what\u2019s real.\n\nAnd that\u2019s what he\u2019s talking about. 2Pac promotes the substitution of the innocently oppressed lower class with that of the elite self-interested upper class.\n\nHe insults them by using a degrading term that resonates with those individuals that make up urban America, \u201cbustas.\u201d This is interesting, he is attributing the meaning of a busta towards elite members, which is typically a reference to a \u201cpunk-bitch fake-gangsa\u201d in the street, someone who betrays you, or is timid to engage in any action. The slang term actually correlates with the actual perception of politicians and elites by the American masses. 2Pac observes all the hard-working colored people in America, that are systematically oppressed and stripped of opportunity, work all their lives for little to no reward.\n\nInteresting how this maybe applied to \u201cundocumented' Latinos in Los Angeles, 2Pac was always conscience of the oppression endured by the Black & Latino (specifically Mexican) community in Los Angeles. He doesn\u2019t hear of white people, the white devils perpetuating all these injustices, dying in the streets only what he perceives to be the innocent colored people in America. Being a black person who\u2019s trying to blend in with the crowd, getting a job, living a normal life and just trying to make it in life is hard, because they are still part of the black community and that\u2019s why the police and society won\u2019t let them make it. This is \u201chopeless\u201d. 2Pac is making an emphasis on the lack of role-models in the colored community, drawing an example by stating that for most of his peers their actual father or father figures are indeed \u201cBase-heads\u201d in other words drug addicts.\n\nTherefore, what can be expected of 2Pac\u2019s peers, their given no guidance in a racist society and placed in disadvantaged socio-economic conditions \u2013 all of which is a combustible mix. Cops are corrupt and just as bad as the people they chase.\n\nOne study of corruption in the Los Angeles Police Department  proposed that certain forms of police corruption may be the norm, rather than the exception, in American policing.\n\nThe Rampart Scandal found more than 70 police officers implicated in some form of misconduct, making it one of the most widespread cases of documented police misconduct in United States history. The convicted offenses include unprovoked shootings, unprovoked beatings, planting of false evidence, framing of suspects, stealing and dealing narcotics, bank robbery, perjury, and the covering up of evidence of these activities.\n\nThe Rampart Scandal is notable in popular culture because at least three LAPD officers implicated in the scandal were found to be on the payroll of hip-hop mogul Marion \u201cSuge\u201d Knight of Death Row Records, a convicted felon with known ties to the Bloods street gang. Moreover, LAPD investigators alleged Rampart CRASH officers Nino Durden, Rafael P\u00e9rez and David Mack were involved in the 1997 drive-by murder of recording artist Notorious B.I.G. The song\u2019s central thesis, echoed throughout the entire track. It is a summation of the contemptuous attitude held towards urban African-Americans by the police and the government, who all too often mistreated and made public examples of them despite struggling efforts to integrate change. This sentiment of the black community versus \u201cThe Man\u201d is especially common to 90\u2019s rap culture (e.g. NWA\u2019s Fuck The Police) and stems from a centuries-old history of rising above abuse, fighting for freedom, and coming up in the world as equals.\n\nInterestingly enough, the melody and lyrical content fits right in with Michael Jackson\u2019s They Don\u2019t Really Care About Us, a song released 6 years earlier that explores similar themes and even has the same tempo! Naturally, Tupac takes MJ\u2019s pop-friendly title and gangsta-fies it on his own level, which almost gives this song a homage-like feel.

His wife questions his manhood, his child has no discipline, his rent is late, and most of all, he\u2019s completely powerless to change any of it unless he dies. One of the realities for people trying to put food on the table is that they have to pick up multiple jobs. This can be quite a precarious position to be in, as one job can often get in the way of doing the other properly. Juggling is an appropriate metaphor, as can be seen below:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlE6FXR9Ko0 Death seems like the only end for his misery. His life is so sad that he feels he would be better of dead \u2013 death would be an improvement. He\u2019s saying that he has to provide for himself, his son, and \u201cthat crazy woman\u201d who he calls crazy because she\u2019s still staying with him even though he\u2019s not doing very well in providing for them. The only way out is to \u201cwalk away\u201d, or to die. It\u2019s the only thing that is \u201cguaranteed\u201d to save him from his own life. He\u2019s barely getting by, and his job\u2019s so shitty that he knows he won\u2019t get that raise even though he busts his ass at work every day. His \u201cnest\u201d his home is rented but his rent is late so he will have to fly or fall\n\nHe lives in a rented home and he is behind on his rent So he\u2019s telling you that you should go do what you want if you can, because you will die, so make it worth it. Lunch meat refers to bologna, which is used colloquially to refer to something obviously untrue. Ergo, swallowing lunch meat is accepting the bullshit that comes with a low-wage job. Kill him, bury him, and forget about him quickly. The sad reality of many peoples' lives. He can barely provide for himself and is attempting to make something out of the nothing he has so he will have enough to survive A friend of the narrator tried to kill himself because he couldn\u2019t stand the hopeless life anymore (same song = same lifestyle)\n\nOriginally, Ant created a beat that was intended for Brother Ali (Slug\u2019s friend) to rap over. Ali was having a lot of trouble with the song, so he passed it over to Slug. Brother Ali tried to \u201ckill\u201d himself by working hard on the same beat (song) that Slug was currently working on. The guitar player for Atmosphere\u2019s touring group, Nate Collis, asked slug if he could improvise on guitar while Slug preformed this song. Slug ended up enjoying the guitar part more than the original beat, so the beat produced by Ant never was recorded.\n\n(Slug said all of this during a 2008 concert at First Avenue in Minneapolis)\n\nFrom an interview with Slug conducted by Complex Magazine:\n\nThe first time I had recorded this song was over a really dark Ant beat that Brother Ali had abandoned. He was trying to write a song about suicide, which is why I say \u2018a friend of mine tried to kill himself to the same song,\u2019 as like a little friendly shout-out. With both of us using Ant\u2019s productions, there are many songs over [beats] Ali made that I couldn\u2019t make work that he made good and a lot of songs he couldn\u2019t make work that I make good. In America today there is a lack of discipline. While his child is clearly in the wrong, to smack a child is so frowned upon he feels like he cannot even discipline his child correctly. Slug is speaking about how those who work these blue collar jobs, the backbone of America, go to the bar for some relief   .\n\nThe truth of happy hour being, mostly no one is there because they\u2019re happy. Most are merely drinking to forget a life they don\u2019t enjoy.\n\nEven if there is no one around he`ll smoke his cigarettes and watch tv, to which the particulars are unimportant, because all of this is merely a distraction from a life he doesn\u2019t enjoy living. Slug\u2019s job has no benefits. The character\u2019s dreams are cut short by the harsh reality of having to take care of his son. When he finally makes some money (\u201cthe color\u201d green), he\u2019ll be so broken down that spending it won\u2019t be enjoyable. When he was younger he always pictured himself as being more  assertive and a better leader than he has become The neighbors are struggling just as much as him and his family are and yet, like most struggling Americans, they try compete over status instead of sympathizing with one another. His tax bracket status, or socioeconomic standing, has got his wife questioning his prowess as a man, or his ability to provide for his family. Slug is insecure about this fact as well. Anyone that\u2019s ever had a shitty car, knows that when it gets too cold, you better have some jumper cables. Although he is behind on all of his bills he still spends money on a lottery ticket. A sad commentary on how he will waste money on hope, an innocent -even sympathetic- act, even in the face of his economic hardships. With the autonomous nature of the work offered to middle america, or the upper lower class makes the individuals nothing more than zombies from the way that they are being treated. Even though the work is killing him inside, he still has to do it for his family. This character looks back wistfully on where he could have been had he done better in school In this song Slug is rapping about those who work by an hourly salary at a blue collar or even lower work level and the hardships they face. The fictitious point of view from which Slug is rapping, is now considering suicide because that is where his tough, working man\u2019s life has brought him. In this song, Slug is rapping not from his own perspective but from the fictional point of view of a poor, working class. His \u201cwife\u201d is mad at him for only being able to afford the cheapest forms of food "},{"album": {"api_path": "/albums/2380", "name": "It's Jimi", "artist": {"url": "http://genius.com/artists/Dj-jimi", "is_verified": false, "image_url": "https://assets.rapgenius.com/images/default_cover_art.png?1460151990", "id": 2515, "name": "DJ Jimi"}, "url": "http://genius.com/albums/Dj-jimi/It-s-jimi", "cover_art_url": "https://assets.rapgenius.com/images/default_cover_art.png?1460151990", "id": 2380}, "song_id": 6104, "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 0, "transcribers": 0, "contributors": 3, "iq_earners": 3, "accepted_annotations": 14, "hot": false, "pageviews": 18110, "verified_annotations": 7}, "artist": {"url": "http://genius.com/artists/Dj-jimi", "is_verified": false, "image_url": "https://assets.rapgenius.com/images/default_cover_art.png?1460151990", "id": 2515, "name": "DJ Jimi"}, "pyongs_count": 12, "title": "Where They At", "annotations": "This 1992 tune is one of the first examples of bounce music.  It\u2019s a cover of DJ Irv\u2019s \u201cWhere Dey At\u201d, which was released the year prior.  This version has the party chants that would soon become ubiquitous all over the globe This record tells the ladies what to do in the club and  \u201ctalks reckless\u201d to the ladies at the same time. Now that\u2019s some funny risqu\u00e9 lyics. Jimi\u2019s show is funny too. Another famous line sampled by several artists.  Jimi had an aggressive flow going on but it was funny to me.  So as a writer/producer it was easy for me and Mellow to accentuate the loose song Jimi had and turn it into a club banger.  We went out in untapped territory not knowing this would evolve into more hits for the club across the U.S. It all went down in New Orleans at Sound Services Studios on Downman Road. The craziest record I ever did but somehow a fun record for the masses. That\u2019s \u201cfeel good music\u201d. In New Orleans, the fellas aren\u2019t afraid to spend a lil change on the ladies. During this time (90\u2019s), it was slang to tell a female you can get this for that, and Jimi creates imagery with the wild and comic rhymes. Another famous line which has been sampled by several dirty south groups. What made us record Jimi? His voice and style were catchy. He had a baritone flow and seemed like he was having fun running his bounce rhyme. Mellow and I were doing a \u201ccall and response\u201d vibe with him cutting \u201cWho\u2019s The Man with the master plan\u201d and I added \u201cThe J. The I. The M. I.\u201d It\u2019s Jimi.  Here we go again adding the roots of hip hop to a bounce record.  We wanted to organize this joint beyond average.  Funny part, that \u201cIt\u2019s Jimi\u201d line ended up being the title of his album. When I first arranged the lyrics, Mellow, Jimi, and myself agreed that this had to be more than just a silly record over the Triggerman instrumental. So I added the intro with our names, New Orleans, J.I.M.I., etc to give it that \u201chip hop\u201d foundation and that was an attention getter once we jumped in the booth together to lay down the intro hook. See this note for an explanation of several of the key lyrical components of bounce music, of which this is one of the earliest examples\n\nAs an unrelated side note, check out this song\u2019s promo sticker The music to this song samples a relatively obscure 1986 song by NYC group The Showboys called \u201cDrag Rap\u201d. For reasons that are now largely lost to history, this particular record, sometimes known by the colloquial title \u201cTriggerman\u201d, formed the foundation of bounce music, and its beat appears in countless early bounce songs\n\nBounce pioneer Mannie Fresh talks about \u201cTriggerman\u201d and its relationship to Southern rap in this fascinating interview.  Even over 20 years after \u201cTriggerman\u201d\u2019s release, it can still get a party started down South:\n\nWhat kind of response would you get, even today, if you were to throw that record on?\nRight now, lets just say you a hot emcee and you open up in New Orleans and you just hear that first little crash on \u201cTriggerman\u201d where the DJ would catch it from, the crowd would go crazy, dude. Like \u201cthat\u2019s my favorite emcee, rocking \u2018Triggerman\u2019\u201d. The repsonse is just straight crazy Unsurprisingly, Mia has a retort to this as well:\n\nAin\u2019t no nigga like a pussy-eating nigga\nCause a slurping motherfucker ain\u2019t shit Mia X has an answer for this chant as well See here for a retort to this famous chant by N.O.\u2019s first lady of hip-hop, Mia X This phrase, which also appears in the original \u201cWhere Dey At\u201d, would be used by other New Orleans hip-hop icon, Bryan \u201cBirdman\u201d Williams, on his 1993 song (under the name \u201cB-32\u201d) surprisingly titled \u201cShake That Ass Like A Saltshaker\u201d This line is sampled from The Kaygees' 1974 song \u201cWho\u2019s The Man (With The Master Plan)\u201d.  The same vocal sample is also used by Dr. Dre in his song \u201cA Nigga Witta Gun\u201d  I mean, the jackets are nice and everything, but really.. DJ Jimi used to spin records during many pussy-popping contests, and recalled how they used to go:\n\nThe pussy pop contest was $500, and they used to go fight for that and then the [men] started coming in here and was winning $500 too! It was serious. You couldn\u2019t mess with them girls back then. $500. A pussy pop contest. Girl, you would get in the middle of that circle and try to get that $500 that Sunday night* Jimi explained how he and DJ Irv came to do two versions of the same song:\n\nWhat that song [\u201cWhere They At\u201d] did, that song made everybody get up\u2026It was a party song\u2026That was something that when you played that record, everybody was getting up and going to dance. There were two copies, two versions of it. Me and Irv was best friends. \u201cWhere They At\u201d \u2013 he was a better DJ. I would come to him as a DJ. He was a beast with it Mellow Fellow remembered the process of creating this song:\n\nDion [Devious] put DJ Jimi\u2019s lyrics in an organized fashion and he had them written down on a piece of paper, and I took that sheet of paper and I took them home and I went in the crates and I looked for every song that says anything related to what Jimi was going to say in the song. I scientifically broke it down and exactly, I knew every song that I put in \u201cWhere They At?\u201d \u2013 in the clubs, it was hot. I just put the combination of all the hot songs together on one song, along with DJ Jimi with the chanting and saying, \u201cWhere they at, where they at,\u201d repetitiously like that. I organized what seemed like was just loosely in the clubs and having fun and partying, and put it on one record. It\u2019s like a party, and putting it on a record Dion \u201cDevious\u201d Norman is a pioneer of N.O. rap who has appeared on and/or produced many seminal bounce songs, including this one, which he co-produced with Mellow Fellow "},{"album": {"api_path": "/albums/10749", "name": "Les Chroniques du 75, vol.2 : En attendant l\u2019Apog\u00e9e", "artist": {"url": "http://genius.com/artists/Sexion-dassaut", "is_verified": false, "image_url": "https://images.rapgenius.com/2avzc50lxr9h33ztp1yup18j3.300x300x1.png", "id": 1261, "name": "Sexion d'Assaut"}, "url": "http://genius.com/albums/Sexion-dassaut/Les-chroniques-du-75-vol-2-en-attendant-lapogee", "cover_art_url": "https://images.rapgenius.com/d611a977f9b8633cd9cb2f738f5363a6.450x450x1.jpg", "id": 10749}, "song_id": 6105, "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 0, "transcribers": 0, "contributors": 5, "iq_earners": 5, "accepted_annotations": 25, "hot": false, "verified_annotations": 0}, "artist": {"url": "http://genius.com/artists/Sexion-dassaut", "is_verified": false, "image_url": "https://images.rapgenius.com/2avzc50lxr9h33ztp1yup18j3.300x300x1.png", "id": 1261, "name": "Sexion d'Assaut"}, "pyongs_count": null, "title": "Mamadou", "annotations": "Solo de Doumam\u2019s sur Les chroniques du 75 vol.2 | 2011 https://twitter.com/Doomamsslinsomn/status/635141513123659776 Phrase propre \u00e0 la sexion et dont ils ont fait un morceau du m\u00eame nomhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=buBmCsOUEsY Son nom et son surnom Le travail leur a niquer le dos comme *bossu de Notre Dame : Il relate l'\u00e9poque de la traite des noirs, durant laquelle les  esclaves \u00e9taient transport\u00e9s en bateau dans les diff\u00e9rents lieux du commerce triangulaire Pr\u00e9server l'environnement co\u00fbte cher, dans un sens g\u00e9n\u00e9ral on pr\u00e9f\u00e8re investir ailleurs C'est le fait d'\u00eatre solidaires qui permettra aux gens des quartiers de r\u00e9ussir sans passer par l'illicite\u2026 donc en achetant les Chroniques du 75 Volume 2 t'aides Doumam\u2019s \u00e0 s'\u00e9loigner de sa vie de rue Pendant que les p\u00e8res se pr\u00e9parent pour la premi\u00e8re pri\u00e8re au lever du soleil, les fils se font p\u00e9ter par la police.

It feels like everybody is against you and trying to do everything in their power to see him fail.  As a result he gets filled up with anger and he cant control the emotion inside of him and how he shows it. Soldiers often tell stories of the horrors of the war, most notably the Vietnam War in the 1987 film \u2018Full Metal Jacket\u2019, the single artwork for \u2018Dirty Harry\u2019 bares strong resemblance to the film poster for \u2018Full Metal Jacket\u2019 Reference to \u201cIn Search Of\u2026with Leonard Nimoy\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCDD76JXLKk A reference to George Bush\u2019s infamous \u201cmission accomplished\u201d speech of 2003. He feels so phased by the killing that is happening around him, but he can\u2019t do anything about it. People will keep dying, and he has to keep killing. He was trained as a soldier to kill, and kill fast. Since he\u2019s good at his job, he\u2019s always on his guard. I got a 90 day extension on his stint in the army. He\u2019s referring to the time before the war when his people lived peaceful lives. This tribe of peaceful people don\u2019t have any formal army so the people must protect themselves with weapons Isuzu motorcycle. Motorcycles are filled up with oil. So, he\u2019s getting oil by working as a soldier overseas. Controversially, the Iraq war is often considered to have been fought over that country\u2019s vast oil reserves. Particularly in Arabian countries. Where the United States have recently invaded Soldiers need weapons to keep themselves from the violent insurgents of countries they\u2019ve invaded.\n\n\n\nThis line is explained in the Bananaz documentary. It\u2019s at 1:42 mark.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3hyNWBmwX0\n\nThe hook and melody was actually taken from Damon Albarn\u2019s I Need A Gun track from the Democrazy EP\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WN1Qvc6gWzA\n\nThis line has a well-honed sense of irony. This album has some strong messages about the shit that\u2019s wrong with the world. They definitely mean one of those problems is constantly trying to solve violence with more violence. Street sweeper is military slang for machine gun.\n\n\n\nNot only that, but the irony of using a street sweeper (like the vehicle) in a desert, where no matter how much you drive it around, you won\u2019t be able to clean the ground. May be a metaphor for the ongoing, unending wars. President wearing army uniform to show \u201csupport\u201d for the troops. Soldiers drink out of canteens.\n\n\n\nLike this. This verse is from the Point of View of a soldier and is performed by Bootie Brown of The Pharcyde. Soldiers carry everything they need in their backpacks: guns, ammo, rations, water, extra clothing. Everything you need to be a trained killer.

Some of high importance, some of no importance. He didn\u2019t know who he could trust so he even came up with a scheme to distance himself from those closest to him. \u201cBees with sweet honey in they mouth have bitter stingers at they tail\u201d\n\nCould be a metaphor to explain how Priest\u2019s girlfriend or wife looks beautiful but has an ugly personality. You can\u2019t trust people with fake personalities.\n\nor could be a reference to sexually transmitted infections.\n\n\u201cBees that have Honey in their Mouth have Stings in their Tail \u2026 So be Careful from People Who pretend to be Sweet \u2026Coz Sweetness is in Honey, not in the bee\u201d Her beauty made him fall in love, but looks can be deceiving. Her beauty hid her true evil nature or sexually transmitted infections.\n\nSimilar to a Wolf in Sheep\u2019s Clothing \u2013 appearances can be deceiving. What\u2019s on the outside can hide what\u2019s inside. \u201cCandles lit\u201d represents Priest starting a romantic relationship with a female.\n\n\u201cGamble with a bitch\u201d means choosing your girlfriend is a risk as you don\u2019t really know their true nature until a few months/years in. He walked through many ghost towns or deserted villages This may be a reference to Priest being in the presence of prophet Muhammad.\n\n\u201cThe history of meditation in Islam begins with the prophet Muhammad. While staying in the city of Mecca, he would visit a nearby mountain and find a cave there. He would meditate in the cave, seeking knowledge, understanding and closeness with Allah. It was during these meditations that he started to receive the revelations of the Quran.\u201d This may be a reference to Mark 10:17-25 famous for the quote, \u201cit\u2019s easier for a camel to go through a needle\u2019s eye than for the rich to get into God\u2019s kingdom\u201d\n\nWhen a man asked \u201cwhat must I do to get eternal life?\u201d Jesus replied, \u201cDon\u2019t murder, don\u2019t commit adultery, don\u2019t steal, don\u2019t lie, don\u2019t cheat, honor your father and mother. Go sell whatever you own and give it to the poor. All your wealth will then be heavenly wealth\u201d This is a quote from Song of Solomon 1:5-6 which means means \u2018I\u2019m dark skinned but beautiful\u2019.\n\n\u201c5 I am black, but comely, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, as the tents of Kedar, as the curtains of Solomon.\n\n6 Look not upon me, because I am black, because the sun hath looked upon me: my mother\u2019s children were angry with me; they made me the keeper of the vineyards; but mine own vineyard have I not kept.\"\n\nHowever, this bar is not completely accurate. KP says he is \u201cblack and comely\u201d like Solomon. Although Solomon may have been black, he didn\u2019t actual say this. It was one of his 700 wives. He came out of hiding at the end of autumn/start of winter possibly because it\u2019s darker for longer periods of times and easier to move about undetected. Priest remembers being in the presence of Jewish \u201cpeasants and kings\u201d.\n\nThis is a reference to Jewish prayers which are recited three times a day: morning lit, afternoon and nightfall. He uses a different name to make it difficult for the police to find him. Priest knows that his death is near.\n\nIn relation to the narrative, he thinks he will be caught and assassinated very soon.\n\nthe \u201csmell of death\u201d is the reported odor people can smell coming from a person just before they die. Whilst on the run, he fears death. In order for the doctors to keep searching for the cures of diseases, they need to \u201charden their hearts\u201d and not get emotionally attached to the patients or effected by their deaths. If not, they would struggle to find the cures that can save millions of people in the future. This is a reference to paganism and the many polytheistic religious traditions (multiple gods) that people followed before the monotheistic (one god) religions became popular i.e. Christianity, Islam, Judaism.\n\nKillah Priest is known for studying religious texts, such as the Bible, but he is even wiser than we think, as he also studied older religious scriptures. A leopard hides, watches and then attacks so it no surprise that KP was nearly killed by a number of leopards\n\n\n\nThis may be a metaphor for almost being killed by a number assassins whilst on his travels. Killah Priest heard a rumour that people working for the FBI had been sent out to assassinate him. By \u2018both species\u2019, Priest is referring to \u201cLove and hatred\u201d. They \u2018lay naked\u2019 in the depths of his mind. They are \u2018in the tomb\u2019 as they are old memories.\n\nPriest uses this verse to meditate and \u2018think back\u2019 on moments with people who gave him love or hatred. This should be \u201cIncrease the fog significantly, change the era\u201d.\n\nThe swarm of \u201cKilla Beez\u201d taking over the industry resembles a fog and it is growing and spreading rapidly. This Hip Hop era will be remembered as the Wu-Tang era. RZA had to explain his plan to the other MCs and the thought of blowing up and making all that money, \u201ckept the jury quiet\u201d. His vision inspired the emcees to jump on board and form the Wu-Tang Clan before attacking the music industry \u2013 \u201cnow a riot will form\u201d.\n\nThe white (devil) Illuminati leaders (satanic man) who control the industry, committed suicide in fear of the Wu-Tang \u201criot\u201d. Starting in New York and the east coast, the \u201cfog\u201d of Killa Beez will spread west and take over the entire country. Following on from RZA\u2019s prophetic vision of the Wu, he explained to the other artists how they could \u201cblow up\u201d if they joined with him to form the Wu-Tang Clan\n\n\u201clike a plane crash from a bomb blast\u201d \u2013 they will blow up / be successful in the music industry Satan\u2019s mistress being death, the death kiss being the \u2018kiss of death\u2019. Everything has a deeper meaning and everything has a purpose, you just have to look beneath the surface. :D\n\nACCEPTED COMMENT: Scratch underneath the surface, where does your purpose lie?\nIt seems our will is worthless, like we\u2019re pawns beneath the sky\n\u201cour will\u201d being worthless \u201clike we\u2019re pawns beneath the sky\u201d is a reference to fatalism (a philosophical doctrine emphasizing the subjugation of all events or actions to fate) GZA maintains a fascination with the game of chess \u2013 a highly intellectual exploit that mirrors his approach to MCing. This is evidenced, among other places, on the cover art of GZA\u2019s seminal album Liquid Swords. (Notice the chess board upon which the figures are fighting.) It\u2019s \u201cEmbracing her was like embracing the 3rd rail\u201d\n\nUnderground metro systems usually have a third rail which carries risk of electrocution. It\u2019s \u201cThe sonic marvel, who just dropped the next novel\u201d\n\nGZA is a notoriously meticulous writer. Since he won\u2019t just use anything in his rhymes, writing lyrics for him is like writing a novel. Also, he calls himself \u201cthe sonic marvel\u201d (i.e. something amazing, that you hear) as a play on his name, the Genius. Wu-Tang notoriously rolls deep, and their extended family is called the Killa Bees. GZA (and many others of his era) paved the way for younger artistes who often neither appreciate the opportunity to learn from his experience in the industry nor better their craft by studying his impressive body of work. \u201cIn a vault\u201d i.e. in a secret meeting\n\u201cthey spoke about the average loss per mission\u201d\nWu-Tang planning to start a battle/war with the rest of Hip Hop and \u201cunskilled skaters\u201d Eight twice is 16, as in bars \u2013 a typical rap verse. Uncut = raw, like cocaine with no additives, while \u201cColt\u201d refers to GZA himself, a lyrical gun, or the \u201ccult\u201d as in his Clan. Figure 8 twice is 8*2 = 16. 16 bars is the standard length of 1 verse . So this line basically means most other rappers can\u2019t rap, the rappers being called \u201cunskilled skaters\u201d as reference to the man-made lake mentioned above .\n\nAnother interpretation is that Unskilled skaters are crack dealers, who don\u2019t have a craft or trade skill. After crystallizing the coke into crack rock, they were unable to get anything more than two \u201ceight balls.\u201d (an 8th of a gram).\n\nACCEPTED SUGGESTION: It is also a reference to how it is popular for skaters to skate a figure 8 in the ice Open to many interpretations as GZA himself said, but the most immediate is the \u201cman-made lake\u201d referring to the rap game/industry, and the \u201csheet of thin ice\u201d referring to over-used ice/bling lyrics. Leading to the following line\u2026\n\nAnother alternative explanation is the following The \u201csheet of thin ice\u201d may be referring to the fragility of being on top of the rap game, as one can easily slip and crash through the ice at any moment. Solomon is a famouse King that is referenced a lot in the old testament in the Bible. Meditation is a word used frequently in popular culture. Mediatation in academic terms is thoughts that extend thought reflection and contemplation The bee symbolizes a women and the honey in the mouth symbolizes their eagerness for sexual engagement. This is a metaphor a shepard guards sheep in the literal sense. In this context the sheep are the humans. Ghandi a political ideological leader who would dwell in the hills. Apparently Killah priest does this also.\n\nIf you want to know more about Ghandi please watch the following\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfHUvW7L5-k Killah Priest is paranoid of the Police putting him on survellience. Gza is rapping through the perspective of being an army soldier observing enemy vehicles. He is reffering to a group that attack with full force and were killed in the process. This could be a connotative reference to African Zulus that fought British Armies but were killed by guns in the zulu war\n\nIf you want to know more about the Zulu wars watch the following\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93IF71ygTB4 Killah priest\n\n\n\nGrew some dreads to conciel his identity from the police We broke bread is symbolic to making money together. Home is symbolic to many things for example in this context it could be Africa (the native home)\n\n\n\nThe studio\n\n\n\nOr New York The double U is symbolic to the W which in turn signifies the Wu Tang clan. Gza\u2019s definition of success is freedom which is different to the typical constraints of a Capitalist society where success is seen as money driven.\n\nIf you wish to explore freedom in a more philosophical way please watch the following\n\n http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtBBFBYFNqs Fake DJs \u201cfire shots\u201d (insults) aimed at emcees for amusement (low pressure water gun play) but are nice to you to your face i.e. give you a high five (\u201cinstantly slap your five like it\u2019s palm Sunday\u201d) The connotation here is biblical as prophets with visions seeing the future is often associated with such texts as the bible etc.\n\nThis is a reference to The Abbott\u2019s/RZA\u2019s vision and goal of creating a successful rap group. GZA is describing his evolution as a rapper with the elements being a reference to Hip Hop. He is a pioneer, started by rapping to a select few on street corners, to using a mic at shows, to making Cds, forming a group with videos and radio singles, worldwide tours. With the advent of the internet he is able to spread his message to an even bigger audience through mp3s, so trying to stop GZA is just \u201chopeless\u201d. Palm Sunday is the holy week for Christian followers He is implying that a) \u201cspecial broadcasts\u201d are paid for and b) he is suggesting that this is unethical. An example of this is infomercials or and paid broadcasts that are on Christain channels that ask for money in return for merchandise. This is ofetn reffered to as Televangelism\n\nWant to know more about Televangelism then watch the following\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXOEAz46vMk Gza is stating that the media use casualties to increase their ratings. He is stating the unethical practice of reporting trajedy for economic gain. Gza is criticising the media industry particularly the radio personalities.

But over time, he had withdrawn so much he lost touch with himself, so he stood up for himself and let his personality show and develop. This verse is about how one\u2019s view of conflict changes from childhood to adulthood.  Fatlip isn\u2019t trying to show off, or act macho, but when he is threatened, if he has to fight, than he is more than willing to.  Really, he needed to learn how to ignore provocation, because haters are aggressive to everybody and you just gotta let it slide most of the time, or fight it out only when it\u2019s really on. The commotion of this situation is making Uncle Imani go crazy. But no matter how bad the times get he will fight it out until the end As the years go on you begin to feel the pressure of the real world In a survival-of-the-fittest world, friends may not be there for you and your problems if they got their own stuff to handle.\n\nMaturity comes both when you find supportive friends to help you when you need it, and when you realize that they can\u2019t always be there, so you start supporting yourself, too. When you mature, there are just those personal situations you got to handle yourself His father was not there to look after and protect him throughout his childhood, but he didn\u2019t complain because he knew he had to stand up on his own two feet.\nAfter a while he had reached a point where he was known for being tough, and that you wouldn\u2019t want to fuck around with him. FatLip is the one spitting the verse His dad was either not there for him or didnt teach him how to fight He would go somewhere safe to eat, and would wonder why people only pick on him.\n\nHe also thinks they are picking on him specifically, and he tried to talk them out of it. Big mistake. Nothing makes you picked on more than saying you don\u2019t deserve it.

On est loin du fanatisme religieux dont on l'a accus\u00e9 croyant qu'il parlait du Jihad mineur c'est-\u00e0-dire de la guerre sainte. Dans l'Antiquit\u00e9 romaine, un pr\u00e9torien est un soldat de la garde pr\u00e9torienne, une petite unit\u00e9 d'\u00e9lite charg\u00e9e de prot\u00e9ger les magistrats importants (\u201cpretor\u201d) Classe de guerriers qui a dirig\u00e9 le Japon durant le Moyen Age Combattant qui se bat au nom de sa religion (qui pratique le Jihad). La liste de conqu\u00e9rants qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de montre que le pouvoir reste toujours au mains de quelques individus tous plus sanguinaires les uns que les autres. Ce sont tous des rois autoproclam\u00e9s qui martyrisent leur peuple pour leur propre int\u00e9r\u00eat.\n\nLe paradoxe est que aujourd'hui; ces tyrans sont per\u00e7us comme \u00e9tant des conqu\u00e9rants et ils sont m\u00eame parfois id\u00e9alis\u00e9s. Duc de Normandie, un puissant duch\u00e9 \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque et roi des Anglais Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte, empereur des Fran\u00e7ais et conqu\u00e9rent de l'Europe continentale Empereur de l'Empire Mongol Roi de Mac\u00e9doine et l'un des plus grands conqu\u00e9rants de l'Histoire Roi des Huns jules C\u00e9sar, dictateur romain Moussa (ou Mo\u00efse dans la Bible) est un proph\u00e8te h\u00e9breu qui a lib\u00e9r\u00e9 son peuple et essay\u00e9 de montrer la vraie religion \u00e0 Pharaon Dans la Bible, David, jeune berger de la tribu de Judas agr\u00e9\u00e9 par Dieu tue le g\u00e9ant philistin Goliath avec sa fronde. Dans la mythologie grecque et plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment durant la guerre de Troie Achille (un h\u00e9ros grec) se bat contre Hector (un h\u00e9ros troyen).\nAchille tue Hector mais au moment de mourir ce dernier pr\u00e9dit la mort de son adversaire.\n\nLors de ce passage, on peut entendre, en fond, un sample du film \u201cTroie\u201d avec Brad Pitt, qui crie le nom d'Hector. Dans la mythologie grecque, le centaure Nessos gagne sa vie en faisant traverser un fleuve. Hercule lui demande de transporter sa femme pendant qu'il traverse par ses propres moyens. Nessos tente de violer la femme d'Hercule et ce dernier l'abat d'une fl\u00e8che empoisonn\u00e9e. Cependant, Nessos demande \u00e0 la femme d'Hercule de recueillir un peu de son sang pour en enduire une tunique cens\u00e9e rendre fid\u00e8le Hercule.\nQuelques ann\u00e9es plus tard comme la femme d'Hercule a des doutes sur la fid\u00e9lit\u00e9 de son mari, elle lui offrira la tunique qui se r\u00e9v\u00e8lera empoisonn\u00e9e par le poison de la fl\u00e8che qu'avait d\u00e9coch\u00e9e Hercule. Celui-ci va se jeter dans un b\u00fbcher tandis que sa femme se pendra.\n\nAinsi, Hercule et Nessos se sont entretu\u00e9s \u00e0 quelques ann\u00e9es d'\u00e9cart M\u00e9dine parle du mythe d'Abel et Ca\u00efn (dans la Bible) ou H\u00e2b\u00eel et Q\u00e2b\u00eel (dans le Coran).\n\nCe mythe raconte l'histoire de ces deux fr\u00e8res, fils d'Adam et \u00c8ve. Tous deux font une offrande \u00e0 Dieu mais seule celle d'Abel est accept\u00e9e. Ca\u00efn tue son fr\u00e8re par jalousie, perp\u00e9trant ainsi le premier meurtre de l'histoire.\n\nLa femme en question pourrait \u00eatre \u00c8ve, car certaines interpr\u00e9tations expliquent la jalousie de Ca\u00efn par le fait qu'il \u00e9tait persuad\u00e9 d'\u00eatre le fils de Dieu selon une phrase qu'aurait dit sa m\u00e8re.

Binary Star\u2019s focus is not on sales but on quality and purpose. His beats and rhymes go together perfectly like each side of a figure eight to become a singular form. A figure eight is also a reference to ice skating, setting up the metaphor that spans the next two lines. A Haiku is a type of poem of Japanese origin. Senin Silla is referring to his raps as poetry that make whoever listen to them more intelligent. An assessment is also known as a test. This is a sample manufactured from KRS-ONE\u2019s 1995 single, \u201cRappaz R. N. Danja. It\u2019s the first line in the 3rd verse, which brings out consciousness that rap/MCing is not the only version of hip-hop. Terrorists (which by definition are people who use violent, ruthless tactics to reach their goal) are known for taking and holding people hostage. Senim Silla flies when he raps; in other words, he has crazy flow. Because his words fly, the source of them should have a cape, like the aforementioned Superman. A survival technique practiced in almost all public places to help \u201cprotect\u201d from tornadoes. The Tigris River is an ancient river that flows through modern day Iraq and Turkey. These lines (including \u201cPop it in your Benz or your bucket\u201d) refer to how Binary Star makes music that speaks to everyone. Rich or poor, whether you live in the city or whether you live in the middle of no where. Mitch Richmond is a retired professional NBA basketball player who played from 1988-2002 and is one of the highest scoring players of all-time. To \u201cshoot the gift\u201d means to use the infinitely referenced \u201cgift of gab.\u201d Definitely refers to Marvel comics, hence the \u201cthis edition\u201d part. Superman says this sometimes when getting ready to fly. Senim is saying his style is so mysterious and enigmatic that he compares his style to the alter ego of Superman, Clark Kent. He does this because no character in Superman seems to wonder where Clark Kent is when Superman is present, meaning Silla\u2019s style is unknown like the whereabouts of Clark Kent. Clark Gable was the star of \u201cGone With the Wind\u201d, One Be Lo is implying that record labels take artists' money and break the hell out. The title of the film also links in with the \u201ctornado\u201d imagery of the next line. Bowling puns: strike/300 (highest possible score in bowling). I.e, no matter how rich you are, you can still enjoy Binary Star; whether you\u2019re playing their tape in a Mercedes Benz or a crap car, a \u201cbucket\u201d. Tonya Harding is a figure skater known for being the most gangster; she essentially put a hit out on competitor Nancy Kerrigan.Nancy Kerrigan was assaulted with a lead pipe in her leg/ankle area, temporarily hurting Kerrigan\u2019s career and ending in a lifetime ban from professional figure skating for Tonya Harding. \u201cBack on the scene like herpes\u201d is making fun of how herpes comes in \u201cflares\u201d and recedes for several months.\n\nBinary Star can get a crowd going no matter how old or intellectual they are. Samantha being the main character from the TV series Bewitched who, of course, did magic tricks of sorts. Wig-splitting = slicing heads and blowing your mind the lyricism. So hip hop nerds (heads) are gonna need stitching. This is in reference to Emperor Napoleon I of France (better known as Napoleon Bonaparte), his expeditions, and the Napoleon complex (which was named after the emperor).\n\n\n\nThe conventional wisdom behind the Napoleon complex is that Napoleon overcompensated for his lack of height by seeking power, war, and conquest; in other words, people say that his height correlated with why he had such an attitude. The term has been created as a social stereotype, as it is generalized that short people act tough for the sole purpose that they need to compensate for their height.\n\n(What\u2019s ironic, though, is that Napoleon was 5'6\", which was the average height of the average 18th century Frenchman at the time. He stood out because he was often seen with his Imperial Guard, as the majority of Imperial Guards were above average height.) Atilla the Hun/Senim Silla, in case it wasn\u2019t obvious. Reference to one of the Pointer Sisters\u2018 most notable hits: \u201cI\u2019m So Excited\u201d. Concluding a none-too-subtle barrage of Superman references. Continuing the idea of Senim as the government: his pockets are the treasury. Establishing a governmental metaphor with the aid of a reference to Eric B and Rakim\u2019s \u201cEric B is President\u201d.

They succeeded somewhat, were eventually found guilty and created a media frenzy surrounding the 1994 US Figure Skating Championships. \u201cI knew this girl who was trying to do some poetry. I had that beat and I was like, \u2018We can just go back and forth on the joint, let\u2019s experiment and see how it turns out.\u2019 And this girl just disappeared. Cats were hating at first. Decompoze was like, \u2018Well I like your verse.\u2019 But Brenda J\u2026she came in and did her thing.\u201d \u2013 One Be Lo (Source) A metaphor for their love. Its safe and guarded, after she stole his heart. She never really felt like she would fall in love or be able to trust a man this well but now she knows she wants to stay. A continuation from the previous line, Abe Lincoln, responsible for the Emancipation Proclamation, has essentially, set her free. The Anonymous is another one of One Be Lo\u2019s many aliases. During Brenda J\u2019s verses, the drum drops and a saxophone is overlaid. That is to signify the interchange between woman and man. They actually have stimulating conversations. Sex without a condom Saying all he has to do is look his girl in the eyes and sub communicate sex, and that\u2019s what happens. He wonders what his girl is thinking, and saying what is on your mind sets you free. It frees the mind like Lincoln freed the slaves. He\u2019s not an amateur at relationships, and says you have to make time for the other person. Communication is important in relationships. Their conversations are enlightening and make him think. Their love unites them at every level. They are \u201ctwo of a kind,\u201d two separate people, but they have a very strong connection. Their relationship goes deeper than sexual attraction. Destiny has fulfilled itself and two lovers are now together. Him and his partner have a sexual understanding, and other women he has seen in the past are wishing they had that with him too Explaining his sexual advances. He attacks like an animal, and his girl surrenders. What good would a butcher be without his knife? The love he has is beyond just looks, but on a level of personality, and brains.

We are being fed bullshit. In a 2011 interview Canibus stated that he feels that when it comes to beefs he is held to a different standard than other MCs. Canibus is not a suckup. he made all these albums and tracks and tries to improve his rap style to improve hiphop, but he is not really respected in the hiphop community nor does he get the fame he deserves Bis claims these people have so much money that they can live their lives with little to ever worry about financially\n\nCirque Du Soleil is a Canadian performance group that consists of \u201ccircus\u201d-like qualities and various forms of entertainment, such as dancing\n\nYou would have to have a real \u201cno care in the world\u201d attitude to parade around your mansion dancing around looking like this: Think Nazi death camps during the holocaust By deeply thinking he is raising his vibrations Deep space euphoria is a condition that astronauts described when they traveled into space, it can be describe has a kind of oneness to everything Taken under the wing of Professor Griff allowed him to be part of Ministry or group that the former Public Enemy member had made. To my knowledge saying grace is a christian ritual. It consists of saying a few words of thanks to God before eating food. Canibus is asking Professor Grif for some support and he happily obliges. This is a reference to the fact that lots of mcs have dissed canibus publically yet they have been heavily influenced by his style. Professor Griff was famously part of Public Enemy. This is expressing the philosophy that beef is just a marketing ploy in Hip Hop to generate more cash. The concept of conspiracy has existed since Adam and Eve. Today ,however, conspiracy theories are a major part of underground and popular culture. Canibus is telling his audience to analyse not just the definitions but the tone of the words as well. To my knowledge QD3 is the company behind the Beef series they were founded by Quincy Jone. If Canibus was a different type of person he would have resorted to soem type of pugilism that would have resulted in criminal legal proceedings. Tevin Cambell money is another metaphor for a lot of monetary incolme. He is stating that the Beef Dvd franchize has made money of artists therefore why are the featured artists not getting paid. This is paying homage to a famouse line by Jay Z on a track called streets is watching. Ksolo and Eazy E are respectable artists in the Hip Hop community. Micheal Jackson money is an obvious metaphor to signify lots of cash. Canibus is asking this question to the Hip nHop Community. This reflects his frustration on the industry. Canibus is reffering discontent to other Rappers, producers and people in senior management positions in this Hip Hop industry. The recipe is a metaphor to the business side of Hip Hop. You is symbolic of the audience listening to his lyrics. Canibus is trying to rationalize his experiences with logic but cant extract any definitive rational. To be on a blacklist means you are neglected by mainstream society to certain previlidges and/or services. \u201cThe weight of the language\u201d is a reference to the harsh tone in his voice. Pacify means ease the agitation. The Zombie dust term is a metaphor for saying that they lied about his agenda. This layered biblical metaphor invokes imagery of a battle between a lion and a dragon i.e. Good vs Evil.\n\n\n\nAlthough Bis refers to the lion as Aslan from C.S. Lewis\u2019s  book series, the Chronicles of Narnia, he is actually referring to the Tribe of Judah which is symbolized as a lion (i.e. Lion of Judah). The Lion of Judah has also been used in the Book of Revelation as a term representing Jesus Christ.\n\nThe Devil is often referred to as a dragon. Thus, the Dragon of Judah represents the evil that was involved in the crucifixion of Jesus i.e. the Roman Empire and Judas (a member of the Tribe of Judah). By labelling Judas as the Dragon of Judah, Bis is highlighting the betrayal of Jesus by one of his own people.\n\nEvil may have killed the leader of God\u2019s Army, but Bis is aiming to build up the following as a vessel to God and to help win the war.\n\nThis metaphor may have an additional layer, concerning how he was betrayed by  LL Cool J, who ultimately executed Bis as a commercial rap artist. He is explaining to his audience the politics in this music Bussiness: Typically Blaxploitation is a film genre in this context it is being used in a negative way to portray the machine behind the Beef Dvds. The \u201cKings\u201d that are treated like apes are symbolic to the rap artists that featured on that Beef Dvd documentary. Canibus is suggesting that the Beef series exploited Hip Hop culture. The Beef Dvd was a documentary about certain Hip Hop tensions that had turned violent. It is directed by Peter Spirer and narrated by ving rhames Empathy as a noun is the following: \u201cthe intellectual identification with or vicarious experiencing of the feelings, thoughts, or attitudes of another\u201d. It appears that Canibus is adressing many groups whether its his fans, the media, his enemies and the Hip Hop comunity in general. Channel zero is a song Canibus recorded a decade ago that speaks elaborately on certain conspiracy theories. He is speaking to his devouted fan base. He is stating that his emmotions can overwhelm him and this can cloud his rational mind. He is saying that your responsible for doing what your suppose to do which to me implies the philosophy of the devine creation. These things your suppose to do are not relieved through ignorance. He is imagining that he was with Ghandi and in this process he saw him weaken through malnutrition. This is a play on words. To say something is unnatural, possibly meaning ungodly, and then using God as a reference of agression to the person he is speaking to. Posturpedic is a reference to firm matresses. The meaning here is literal but there is a metaphor, Canibus is sleeping heavily on his compitition. Canibus is communicating to the Hip Hop community to wake up and fight injustice. He is referencing himself in the third person and is acknowledging that his \u201cparanoid statements\u201d are put of his intellectual celebrity. A ghetto PHD is street knowledge that is ordained not by an education system but by the streets. Interesting imagery of comparing himself to a computer and being supernatural. It is a fascinating juxtaposition. The context one suspects is of a dream like state. He is reffering to world leaders like Obama going into spaceships and liasing with aliens. He is stating that the evolution of the human mind is separate of Macbooks or PCs. This may be either an ironic or layered statement. The connatative message here may refer to the racial beatings suffered by the police. Rodney King is a famous case in America This lyric consciously or unconsciously gives an insight into Canibus\u2019s thoughts on Animals. He is putting himself of the position of being a scientist as this would be a duty of Scientists that specialize in certain areas. A chacra is one of seven energy points in the physical body We need information about the time period to question the authenticity of Jesus. A behemoth is a beast in the book of Joab . In this context he may be reffering metaphorically to the music industry. Pedagogy in its literal sense means styles of teaching. In this context it is reffering to someone who has labbelled him a communist. An emporium is a place that sells goods. The context of this lyric is that he sells metaphors. Bis' metaphor shop was inspired by the 2007 film, Mr. Magorium\u2019s Wonder Emporium, starring Dustin Hoffman as the 243 year old toy store owner, Mr. Edward Magorium.

(and he still takes pun`s royalties meant for his family) fuck fat joe Pap make sure that the real bronx cats is who he respects Joe dont act or speak like ill ass bronx niggas who are known for not takin shit When Pap' snuffed Joe, Joe was hanging with security.

Charlie Rock now can\u2019t see from one eye and that bitch Joe isn\u2019t even taking care of this man in or even out jail. Fat Joe tried to get his chain back by calling up the supposed robber, in voice messages to the robber he can be heared begging for his chain and since that don\u2019t work out the bitch proposed to give money for it. Fat Joe got robbed of one of his Terror Squad chains. If you lose your Jesus Piece in the hood, you lose your respect and street cred. Pap' is hollerin' at everyone to put the word on the street that he wan\u2019t to fight Joe one on one. The recent \u201cTerror Squad\u201d (Fat Joe\u2019s group) who now contains Fat Joe, Cool & Dre, DJ Khaled and K.A.R. as members is too fucked up and ugly. He makes clear that it\u2019s \u201cThe NEW Terror Squad\u201d that\u2019s fucked up because back in the days \u201cTerror Squad\u201d rocked some dope rappers like Big Pun & Cuban Link. Papoose doesn\u2019t wanna diss these members in any way. \u201cDJ\u201d Khaled from Joe\u2019s team can\u2019t DJ for shit. Because it was rumoured that Lil Wayne was ghost writing for Fat Joe, Papoose states that in that case Lil Wayne should get tax money from Joe. He explains that the beef between him and Fat Joe isn\u2019t shit cause Joe ain\u2019t nothing. He compares it to the 2008 US Presidential elections where Obama was VS. Hillary and that it was easy to beat her since Obama is black and intelligent and Hillary is just a woman. In his comparisation he compares himself to \u201cObama\u201d and Fat Joe to \u201cHillary\u201d. Again he asks Fat Joe to fight him one on one. Papoose is reffering to when he punched Fat Joe in the face while Joe\u2019s security was there acting scared and doing nothing. They were probably wearing Timberlands. Fat Joe and his security got knocked by Pap' and his team. Instead of Stack Bundles dying, it should have been Fat Joe. PAPOOSE FUCKS SAAD KHUSHNOOD VIGORIOUSLY!!!!!!! Gay.

Papoose had scrapped with Fat Joe\u2019s crew prior to dropping this diss He\u2019s making a pun off his use of a baseball bat on Fat Joe\u2019s crew Fat Joe got tight with DJ Khaled and other South rappers Big Pun\u2019s wife and kids were living in a shelter at the time of this song dropping. Pun got Fat Joe to where he is today, and Joe obviously didn\u2019t send any of his money their way. The Jay-z/Nas beef was legendary Papoose is saying that Fat Joe\u2019s new rapping style and persona is so obviously borrowed from Lil Wayne. It was rumored that Lil Wayne was ghostwriting for Fat Joe at the time.

And Papoose definitely doesn\u2019t like that album.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cElephant in the room\u201d is an English metaphorical idiom for an obvious truth that is either being ignored or going unaddressed.\nMaybe Papoose is saying he\u2019s a real rapper and he doesn\u2019t want any truths to be ignored. A mixed martial artist who has beat the shit out of a lot people. Papoose decides to tell Fat Joe he is a \u201cpunk\u201d and a \u201cpussy\u201d in Pig Latin, which translates to \u201cunkpay\u201d and \u201cusspay\u201d. Big Pun was a rapper who worked with Fat Joe, but died at only 28.  Fat Joe gained more attention when he started working with Big Pun and Papoose is saying he is the only reason Fat Joe got famous.

The animal goat is the symbol of the astrological sign Capricorn.  Kweli melds these ideas together by rapping an acronym for the word \u201cCapricorn\u201d here Another great meta-moment, with Jean this time counting the times she says \u201cmurder\u201d instead of counting bars In quick succession, Grae uses the word \u201cburn\u201d in a bunch of different ways:\n\n\nTo digitally copy audio, as in \u201cburning\u201d a CD\nTo lose, or \u201cburn\u201d, calories by exercise\n\u201cBurner\u201d is slang for gun This reversed section was originally \u201cBlack Star\u201d, in reference to Mos Def and Kweli\u2019s group of that name.

She also uses the insult \u201cscatterbrain\u201d quite intentionally, to blend in with the face and brain imagery of this section Jean uses a rather amusing image to demonstrate her lack of giving a fuck, an idea she addresses more directly elsewhere on Cookies or Comas This part of the hook was originally \u201cthe BOYS are back\u201d, as the song was supposed to feature, in addition to Jean, Talib\u2019s Black Star partner Mos Def.

Getting so intoxicated that their bodies go out of control. In the background Eminem can be heard crazily laughing at the shout out by Trick Trick. After another alcoholic shot he now finds himself out of control and flailing all over the place.\n\nHpnotiq is an alcoholic beverage.\n\n\n\nRobots have wires and electric systems, and blowing a fuse is a safety component in electronic and electrical device disabling. If Em were a robot he would have blown more than one fuse. Em is fixing to start some trouble but he needs to pick a woman to take home before he can start it up. Trick Trick puts out music that you would play at a club and it\u2019s making Em wanna party and dance, and he just may end up hitting someone in the face incidentally because of how he is flailing around and how crazy it is in there. Em is scanning the party scene and he is seeing some hot women, and he needs to leave there with some phone numbers so he can get with them later, and they come pretty fast it sounds like. As soon as he gets this drink dumped on him he already knows he\u2019s headed for jail because he is going to start a fight with this dumbass. Bacardi is an alcoholic beverage, and some dumbass spills his drink all over Em\u2019s knitted garment. Shit could get ugly. Em is strictly just trying to have a good night and unwind from his daily stresses, not beef with anybody. This is one of the first songs from Eminem ever since his comeback.\nIt\u2019s been 3 years from the last Trick-Trick & Eminem collab.\nNew song from Trick-Trick again. Double meaning:\n\n\nearlier refers himself relevant to a robot, with his robotic like movements\nalso, a metaphor meaning the \u2018idiot\u2019 is pushing Em past his limits enough that he isn\u2019t even worried to go to jail Eminem\u2019s \u2018homies\u2019 try to stop him from dancing because he\u2019s beginning to dance sloppy, when he tries to explain it\u2019s just his swagger even though he has been taking shots of hypnotic earlier. Taking the laces out of your shoes is clearly a safety hazard for anyone entering jail, making it easy to strangle or hang yourself.\n\nShoe laces have also been used as an escape, with a case in 2010 of a man escaping jail twice by using them to pick the cell lock. The act of having sex with one of these \u2018bitches\u2019 for self pleasure, rather than even bothering to try to get the women to orgasm. In other words he just wants to get the fuck outta there! He is saying he comes up with the ideas/lyrics he puts out. Paul (Eminem\u2019s manager, a founder of shady records), Jimmy Iovine (cofounder of Interscope Records), & Dre (beats producer) don\u2019t come up with the crazy stuff he says. In an interview Wayne complained about reaching out to Eminem, and Em not returning calls, and here Em is responding, but subliminally because he\u2019s talking about bitches in the club, and how they could have gave head so he\u2019ll shake her hand, and not kiss them, as well as poking fun at Wayne kissing Birdman on the lips.\nThe video is here\u2026\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK9jtdsCIhs "},{"album": null, "song_id": 6137, "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 0, "transcribers": 0, "contributors": 9, "iq_earners": 9, "accepted_annotations": 0, "hot": false, "verified_annotations": 0}, "artist": {"url": "http://genius.com/artists/Travis-porter", "is_verified": false, "image_url": "https://images.rapgenius.com/467cbf3de1c96aa93c1a59e84bfca1e6.640x425x1.jpg", "id": 1355, "name": "Travis Porter"}, "pyongs_count": null, "title": "Dem Girls", "annotations": "?

Earl sees beyond these performances:\n\n\n\n(1) Straightforward: through Ray-Bans, simultaneously conveying a sense of great cool and that same composure so characteristic of the sneak tip.\n\n\n\n(2) This connection is probably a stretch, but \u2018They Live\u2019 (1988, John Carpenter) is a film which\u2019s protagonist, displaying the aforementioned attributes, discovers a box of sunglasses which allow him to see beyond the facade of American reality, the institutions of consumer capitalism.\n\n\n\nMarxian philosopher, psychoanalyst Slavoj Zizek went so far as to say, in \u2018The Pervert\u2019s Guide to Ideology\u2019 (2012, Sophie Fiennes) that if everyone had They Live glasses, capitalism would face imminent downfall and the people would be liberated from their circumstances, as he\u2019d\u2013and critical theory, a discipline covering issues from similar facets and methodologies\u2013describe it. Wouldn\u2019t put it behind Earl to engage in this sort of discourse. An ironic parody by Earl of how the word nigga is in the majority of rap songs. He says it at the last minute so as to fit it in and seemingly make his song like the rest.\n\nIt also indicates that the entire song was directed at one person Clearly, as Earl puts it here, Earl\u2019s stuff is thought-provoking and genius Earl\u2019s wondering who else wants to step to the Wolf Gang A rhetorical question he poses to the hoes waiting in line to swallow his erections. Of course, every girl wants to go next! Earl\u2019s had the ability to rip microphones apart ever since he was a young whippersnapper with poor nasal hygiene. And, when you consider he wrote this line when he was fourteen, it really makes you wonder just how good he still can become.\n\nThis also references lines from the MF DOOM song \u201cHey!\u201d from Operation: Doomsday and the last line of \u201cAll Caps,\u201d the instrumental he\u2019s currently rapping over. girls know earls raps are sick Knees are usually the easiest part of the body to break, and once you break your knee, it\u2019s most likely never to be the same. Earl breaks people and leaves them to be forever scarred by him. he wont give a shit once your killed Just watch, I'mma kill \u2018em all ACCEPTED COMMENT: Earl is saying that even though these other niggas have their eyes open they don\u2019t really see the truth\u2026 i.e. how Earl is hands down the hardest. Also possibly saying that you won\u2019t sleep because you\u2019re staying up all night listening to his music.\n\nThe No-Doz (a caffeine pill) part references how you can feel tired and depleted even though you\u2019re awake. So someone with eyes wide shut feels like they\u2019re asleep even though they\u2019re carrying out their daily routine.\n\nFinally, it\u2019s an oxymoron. Earl and Tyler are known for their use of juxtaposition, the comparison of two contrasting ideas. He\u2019s using a clever literary technique.\n\n\u2018Eyes Wide Shut\u2019 is also 1999 film directed by Stanley Kubrick. Makin' the track sick. its flaming not playing, and its a weed term, instead of saying blazing he says flaming, weed gets you \u201chigh\u201d flaming could also mean hot so he uses both those terms to come at the competition, saying i hit \u201cflaming\u201d niggas with \u201clow\u201d blows suck my dick dumb fuck Describing his hoes as \u201cbisexual\u201d meaning they are \u201cflexible\u201d with what gender they are attracted to, and that they are physically flexible. Steez is a combination of Style and Ease. His style is so sweet that it attracts bees like honey does. Andre Kirk Agassi is a retired American professional tennis player and former World No. 1. This could be a reference to the supervillain MF DOOM. He is a rapper that inspired Earl, and who the beat of this song comes from (well, technically Madlib but DOOM rapped over it). DOOM got his name from the Fantastic Four comics, where Dr. DOOM was the villain. This could mean Earl is hoping to \u201ckill\u201d DOOM on his own beat. bees are attracted to sweet things, he\u2019s sweet. earl often raps about kidnapping people To hate someone, you need to recognize them, ergo Earl gets recognition from his haters. the last guy who tried to pass him got slapped. black women\u2019s asses are stereotypically large and slappable, men often do this. he\u2019s the best lyricist excuse all the people he\u2019s killed wherever they go, shit gets wrecked. He gets money and can show off without ever messing up. play on \u201cAmazing Grace\u201d\n\nEarl originally used this analogy on his first recorded song, \u201cWattstax.\u201d Rappers are stereotypically black.\n\nIn the slavery era, slave-owners would \u201cwhoop\u201d (beat) slaves if they misbehaved.\n\nEarl is saying he beats so many rappers (characterized as \u201cniggas\u201d), he could be accused of racism. He skates, hence the Nike SBs (skating shoes). If you disrespect Earl, he\u2019ll kick you in the face while wearing \u2018em.\n\n\n\nConsidering MF DOOM\u2019s influence on Earl, and Odd Future in general, it may be worth noting that the masked rapper has custom Nike SBs with his logo on the sides: Play on \u201ccut to the chase\u201d, says race because he can connect that he wins them A doctor has patients. A calm doctor has patience (and lots of patients, as being patient is a good trait for a successful doctor). Therefore, said doctor has \u201clots.\u201d However, Earl trumps him by the number of flavors he boasts. It\u2019s amazing that he\u2019s so young, and yet spits fire hotter than the scalding summers of Mexico. Earl\u2019s referring to ejaculating in multiple hos' mouths. Also, if it\u2019s going down the neck, them bitches swallow too! As Biggie put it, things done changed. Usually kids who wear tucked in shirts are not that tough, but he was When he says \u2018feelings\u2019, it sounds like \u2018More than villains get hurt when the shotty goes\u2019, referencing the fact that he\u2019s rapping over Madvillain\u2019s \u201cAll Caps\u201d beat. When Earl spits, he induces physical pain because of how exceptional it is. Toilet seats get a lot of ass, he gets more\n\nThis also bears similarities to one of Nate Dogg\u2019s lines on Eminem\u2019s song \u201cShake That:\u201d\n\n\u201cSmoke so much weed you wouldn\u2019t beleive\nAnd I get more ass than a toilet seat\u201d "},{"album": null, "song_id": 6139, "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 0, "transcribers": 0, "contributors": 23, "iq_earners": 23, "accepted_annotations": 27, "hot": false, "pageviews": 9588, "verified_annotations": 0}, "artist": {"name": "Domo Genesis", "url": "http://genius.com/artists/Domo-genesis", "iq": 578.0, "image_url": "https://images.rapgenius.com/3af29a0ec9566795f813057ecbf6c314.675x1000x1.jpg", "is_verified": true, "id": 1190}, "pyongs_count": 2, "title": "Tang Golf", "annotations": "OFWGKTA members Domo Genesis and Hodgy Beats did a cover of GZA\u2019s song \u201c4th Chamber\u201d from Liquid Swords\n\nThis song was released on April 1, 2011, along with several others including 50 Cent\u2019s I\u2019m All Turn\u2019t Up, and Pharrell\u2019s The Came Has Changed.\n\nDownload it here Left Brain\u2019s beats are known for their use of percussion.

The left side of the brain processes logical thought, dealing with lists and organization. Left Brain is a producer for OFWGKTA who primarily works in the duo Mellowhype making beats, producing, and sometimes rapping alongside Hodgy Beats.\n\n\n\nOn the left is Hodgy beats, and right is Left Brain The real explanation for this line is pretty simple. The cock is the \u201cham\u201d and the cum is the \u201cmayonnaise\u201d in the figurative sandwich that the bitch is eating. Clout is another term for respect, influence, and ultimately, swagger. Homicide prone like Amanda Knox, but in contrast, Hodgy isn\u2019t getting caught, OR prosecuted by the Italian government. Wolf Haley (one of Tyler, the Creator, front man of OFWGKTA\u2019s several rap personalities) is the instigator in the group.\n\nHe\u2019s not an instigator, and he doesn\u2019t have several rap personalities. He calls \u2018Wolf Haley\u2019 the voice inside his head. Other than that, there\u2019s just Tyler, the Creator and Dr. TC who\u2019s his conscience. As many rappers, Domo is obligated to be hard on his hoes. On the contrary, Domo is very nice at writing raps with his pencil, pronounced loosely to rhyme with \u201ccancel.\u201d A Nazi concentration camp reference. The Odd Future camp puts weak music to trash like Nazi concentration camps did to the Jews in the Holocaust Large crowds of fans often \u201ccamp out\u201d for new material.  Domo doesn\u2019t have to since he gets merch sent to him. As the letter H comes after the letter G in the alphabet, this song is on a level past Gangster. A beautiful pen-and-ink style of writing using a reed brush, that really does require \u201cHandsome passion\u201d to do. It\u2019s \u201ctan Camry\u201d, as in a tan Toyota Camry. It\u2019s the car Domo used to have and is a good representation of a \u201ccommon car\u201d, which is then paralleled in the next line (since I was 16 I had dreamed of them red Lambos) Nike Vandals. BAPE, or A Bathing Ape clothing, is a company from Japan that manufactures street wear clothing and is known for being quite pricey.\n\nBAPE clothing is often sported by rappers such as Kanye West, Pharrell Williams, Lil Wayne, and others.\n\nKanye also has a line about BAPE clothing, containing some witty innuendo in Katy Perry\u2019s song E.T.. In other words, he\u2019d get away with murder (as Amanda Knox \u2013 a study abroad student in Italy who allegedly flipped out and killed another girl \u2013 seems to have done..) Hodgy occasionally Tweets about these fellows\n\nDavid and Clancy are Odd Futures managers. This is a sample from the movie \u201cShogun Assassin\u201d which was on the song first featured with the beat \u201c4th Chamber\u201d by GZA Hodgy Beats is more than likely sleeping with the judge, causing her to execute the judicial system less effectively. Syd is the only female member of OFWGKTA.\n\nOdd Future enjoys giving out false information about Earl\u2019s whereabouts, in this case implying that he was kidnapped by Samoans.\n\nComplex Magazine contends that he is at Coral Reef Academy in Samoa Gold diggers always try to get at Mike G, another member of OFWGKTA \u201cFree Earl\u201d is a reference to frontman Tyler, the Creator\u2019s half-brother Earl Sweatshirt, who has recently gone M.I.A. The group won\u2019t disclose his location, simply stating that he\u2019s \u201cOn Vacation. I\u2019m guessing that, wherever he is, it probably rhymes with \u201csnail.\u201d\n\nAnother rumor about Earl\u2019s whereabouts is that his mother sent him to Boarding School after a run in with the police. Earl is rumored to be released once he turns 17 on April 11, 2011.\n\nEarl\u2019s enrolled in the Samoan Coral Reef Academy, a place for parents to send their young male delinquents. His birthday is February 24, and he\u2019s already 17. It\u2019s unclear whether or not he\u2019ll get out before he turns 18, but until then he will be legally unable to release any material as per his mother\u2019s resistance. When Domo raps, it\u2019s like he\u2019s spitting fire because it\u2019s so dope. When his rhymes touch something they melt it like candles after they\u2019ve been lit for a while\n\n\n\nAlso he says shit drips when he spits because usually when you spit (literally) drool drips down your chin. Mantle is the hot molten rock under the crust of the Earth\u2019s surface. Domo is as hot as that\n\n\n\nThis could also be mantle as in \u201cmantle piece\u201d, which, being directly over a fire, would also be quite hot. This also links into the next line: people put candles on mantles. If success was a door and it was closed for Domo Genesis he would lock pick the handle so he could open it. He is determined to become successful "},{"album": {"api_path": "/albums/13280", "name": "Sleeping in Class", "artist": {"name": "Casey Veggies", "url": "http://genius.com/artists/Casey-veggies", "iq": 3253.0, "image_url": "https://images.rapgenius.com/49310d45281b7ee3d7f09fa5160ef8e0.600x644x1.jpg", "is_verified": true, "id": 2011}, "url": "http://genius.com/albums/Casey-veggies/Sleeping-in-class", "cover_art_url": "https://i.embed.ly/1/display?key=fc778e44915911e088ae4040f9f86dcd&url=http%3A%2F%2Fkillerboombox.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2011%2F09%2FSleeping-In-Class-Deluxe.jpg", "id": 13280}, "song_id": 6140, "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 0, "transcribers": 0, "contributors": 38, "iq_earners": 38, "accepted_annotations": 60, "hot": false, "pageviews": 20529, "verified_annotations": 0}, "artist": {"name": "Casey Veggies", "url": "http://genius.com/artists/Casey-veggies", "iq": 3253.0, "image_url": "https://images.rapgenius.com/49310d45281b7ee3d7f09fa5160ef8e0.600x644x1.jpg", "is_verified": true, "id": 2011}, "pyongs_count": 5, "title": "DTA", "annotations": "DTA is a rogue status sub-brand, local to LA \u2013 here, Odd Future has essentially a clothing commercial done in rap form..

The movement of this mainstream idea at the time that Jordans were hot and cool , everyone wanted them , the shoes would make you become cooler forced a mindset on macklemore to buy the kicks, spend his money on a product(consumer) and this mindset that the shoes would improve his image consumed him and he lost sight of what the shoes really did. He refers to himself as an individual, someone unique but he is part of a bigger group of people who all buy jordan sneakers for the look, and the content of just having them. He wants people to see him and what he has, he has what everyone  wanted Jordan sneakers. He believed it made him cool. Human nature settles into his mind, Macklemore paid a lot just to have a pair of shoes so he had to show them off , let everyone see he had something very few people had. Consumed is a play on blind consumption taking over his mind. Everybody wore the Mike\u2019s shoes because they wanted to be like Mike, like be amazing at basketball and be really rich.\nHe is suggesting that America\u2019s consumerism drives kids to want the things he has so badly that these shoes take over their life Most nice basketball shoes are about hundred bucks and most people wear them even though they don\u2019t play ball, or they don\u2019t wear shoes meant for ball on the court because they don\u2019t wanna ruin them. He was trying to become a pro without practicing and thought that with the shoes this was possible We always want what we can\u2019t have, and if we attain it, we feel superior to other around us. This theory makes us flaunt what we have to make others admire us. A crease is \u201ca line made by pressing, folding, or wrinkling\u201d, which makes the shoe look older.\nHe was conscious about this and tried to avoid getting them on his shoes.\n\n\n\nBecause the material on the toebox of the Airmax 90\u2019s is really tough, it makes it harder for them to crease. He was captivated by every aspect of getting the shoe, from the plastic paper in the box, to the smell of the shoe, to the trend of the soles. The branding for Air Maxes tell you that the air bubble at the back of the shoe will make you jump higher, he bought into this hype.\n\n\n\nACCEPTED COMMENT: The Air maxes could be a representation of an addiction to the fame or the popularity of having nice shoes; it keeps escalating. Trying out his pair of Nikes for the first time. The image that Nike passed on to us was that these shoes would make you play like Jordan. As a placebo, Macklemore could touch the net and accomplish a dream.\n\nThe bubble also refers to the air pocket below the heel of the Nike Air 4s.\n\nThe ones with the Nike Air logo are the originals, the Jumpman logo marks a remake.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso, \u201cI swear i got so high\u201d may me interpreted as in \u201cgetting high\u201d \u2013 in an euphoric state of mind.\n\nThe use of \u201cfly\u201d here can also be dually interpreted. In sense, Macklemore is hoping the shoes will increase his performance so he can jump higher, or essentially \u201cfly\u201d. In another sense, he\u2019s going to be so much cooler than the other kids in his school because how many broke 7-year olds do you know with a pair of brand new Nike Airs? Therefore, this would make him fly, and it apparently worked.\n\nMacklemore also is saying that the air bubble in the shoe will give him a voice because he is going to be fly (fashionable). He is very clever because a air bubble can also be a speech bubble like in cartoons. The shoes were so valuable that he was afraid to actually wear them and depreciate their value. The wordplay here is about the box. In an earlier line he referenced leaving the shoes in the box and uses that reference to relate following the herd or breaking from the pack and thinking outside the box. Air Jordan\u2019s are given an inflated value by the price tag and fame to make people (like Macklemore) believe they are more than shoes: they enable people to fly, to reach their dreams. The line \u201cGive me a star to reach for\u201d is a bit of a double entendre: he means both reaching for the stars AND reaching the star of the Jordan shoe line- Michael Jordan. \u201cStitch the wings and pull the strings\u201d reveals how disillusioned with the shoes people become, as they buy into this image and let the shoe company \u201cpull the strings\u201d like puppeteers selling people this dream.\n\n\n\nConsumerism as a whole is essentially a fast way of obtaining the illusion of happiness or contentment when in reality, actually obtaining either of these feelings is much more difficult. The shoes give you the power to be fly (fashionable) but it really enslaves you and chains you down so you cannot fly.\n\nFinally, \u201cAll fall down\u201d can be interpreted as a reference to the nursery rhyme \u201cRing Around the Rosie,\u201d which urban legend has it had to do with the plague. So Macklemore is indirectly relating the contagiousness of consumerism and greed to the plague.\n\nNote as well that there\u2019s another song about consumerism (albeit a different side of it \u2013 namely how it makes you self-conscious) called All Falls Down. \u2026of these (Nike Bred 4\u2019s) Fact: Shoes with velcro (i.e. Pro Wings) were not dope back in the day\n\n\n\nFact: Velcro shoes have come a long way.\n\n\n\nLinks into \u201cThrift Shop,\u201d \u201cI could take some Pro Wings, make them cool, sell those\u201d he is talking about Pro Wings and how he is able to make them cool through his own style. However when he was younger, he was told that the Nikes were much better until, \u201cSee, it consumed my thoughts.\u201d His friend was probably playing basketball with some shady people, and before he knew it, he probably got shagged or something.\n\nReferencing the OTHER trend at the time, which was repping your team on your Starter jacket. And, unfortunately, people were senselessly murdered over this item of clothing, as well as the various types of Nikes.\n\n\n\nThere is clear pun here on \u201cstart a cult,\u201d foreshadowing the critique of consumerism later in the song. However, if you look at the context of the lyrics, it\u2019s clear that he\u2019s describing the climate of Seattle in the early \u201890s and the threat of getting robbed for your gear (Jordans, starter coats, etc.) The lyric has a double meaning, but it is \u201cstarter coat.\u201d The neighborhoods between Genesse Park and Othello Park were not places you wanted to get caught wearing your fly, new Nikes and/or Starter coat. If you\u2019re sporting Pro Wings, as mentioned in the next line, you might be susceptible to ridicule\u2013or even get murdered for your shoes. Macklemore\u2019s friend\u2019s brother got murdered over a pair of Air Jordan IV\u2019s.\n\nThey are pretty dope though.\n\n\n\nNot the first time that a rapper\u2019s friend got murdered for his shoes:\n\nBeen banging\nSince my lil' nigga Rob got killed for his Barkleys\n\nThe Seattle-based rap group The Knowmads also talk about a guy who \u201cgot shot on his own street for some white Nike Air\u2019s\u201d in their song \u201cReturn of the Jedi\u201d. It could possibly be the same person. This line has the triple meaning of:\n1. Sticking out the tongue on his shoes so everyone could see the Jumpan logo and cursive writing that were symbolic of the Jordan brand.\n2. A reference to Michael Jordan\u2019s iconic tongue hanging out of his mouth when he played\n3. Nike made even book bags look cool\n\n1:\n\n\n\n2:\n\n\n\n3: \u201cJust Do It\u201d is Nike\u2019s highly recognized slogan.\n\n\n\nThe ways shoes were advertised and perceived by a wide audience made him feel the need to fit into the social norm by buying these shoes. After the murder of Carlos' brother, Macklemore no longer wants to be defined by what\u2019s on his feet and the Nikes defined him. By wanting to \u201ctake his off\u201d, he wants to redefine his image and not remain victim to blind consumption and the shoe\u2019s inflated value. What started as the ultimate sneakerhead anthem, ends with Macklemore admitting that Nike\u2019s are just shoes, not an identity. It didn\u2019t matter that he wasn\u2019t good at Basketball, he had the dopest kicks Four stripes means that they couldn\u2019t even afford an original Adidas and had to wear fake ones, with four stripes instead of three When Macklemore looked into himself, he felt that he was duped by this guy Phil Knight, who is the co-founder of Nike.

Notable for being one of the controversial group\u2019s \u201cclean\u201d songs, and for Dre\u2019s lyrical disavowal of weed, only a few years before his album-long celebration of the drug.\n\nThere was also an extended mix with a tougher beat and additional lyrics from Ice Cube and Ren.\n\nSide Note: Although Eazy-E is often described as Charles Wright\u2019s nephew or son, Charles Wright himself has denied any relation. Dr Dre \u2013 mainly a DJ and producer \u2013 has and always will provide funky beats to get funky on. Dre along with the rest of N.W.A reflects his attitude on his lyrics, but to do that and be heard \u2013 they surely need good skills at rapping. http://genius.com/3891334 If he keeps delivering verses he surely is going to do metaphoric damage since he delivers the truth, the reality.\n\nOr \u2026 he might get soooo hyped that he\u2019s driven crazy by his own lyrics.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that this is first Dr Dre\u2019s solo in a N.W.A song. He barely had a verse in N.W.A before Ice Cube\u2019s departure, he was the producer along with DJ Yella. You can say N.W.A are macabre, reckless and offensive all you want \u2013 but you know at some point you need somebody to bring the reality out in the spotlight. This is a suggestion by the doctor which goes by: if you want to be succesful, be yourself! The way you express yourself plays a major role in your music/art. 180\u00b0 from other people; those who do and are whatever society tells them to do and be, Dr.Dre is just being what he wants and not what he\u2019s told.\n\nExpressing themselves was the main point of N.W.A, who delivered to the public whatever they wanted, especially their ghetto-reality. Dre calls out all the people who  just follow the current trends, do whatever others do, and fail to be original; all the people who fail just can\u2019t see, to express themselves in an authentic fashion.\n\nNote how the words \u2018again and again\u2019 mimic the spinning of a record. Basically all year round! Cube and Dre set up the scene of the song. \u201cFlakin'\u201d means trying to get someone\u2019s attention while \u201cperpetratin\u2018\u201d means faking it. They are essentially scared to put out a track.\n\nIce Cube alludes to the fact that Dre has been producing a lot of the album, and opens \u201cExpress Yourself\u201d: Dre\u2019s first solo track in his career. It was an anomaly at that time to see a DJ rapping as well\u2026.him and Quik revolutionized this He wants Yella to provide some funky beats everytime he begins to rap (express himself).\n\nDJ Yella produced beats for NWA along with Dr Dre himself. Here, Dr Dre is giving notes on the gestation period. He might have done biology in high school. He\u2019s comparing the growth of his knowledge to a fetus. A fetus develops into an embryo and the gestation period  takes about 9 months. This means Dre expands his knowledge for a stretch of 9 months. Basically, the Dr shuns inconsistency in behaviour as well as musicians that \u201cspice up\u201d their musical content or their image to get more appeal or to be accepted by a certain group of people.He\u2019s saying if you\u2019re going to be you, be you 100% everywhere and all the way. Be real. Throughout the three verses of the song, Dre continues the idea of Rap as the conveying medium of their feelings, specifically as a lesson he is trying to teach out through these verses to everyone.\n\nHe feels every confession of failure in anyways to express, has its answer with a Smith & Wesson gun in his hand. Just like an embryo growing into a baby, Dre has many rhymes in his mind that he needs to express. It won\u2019t be long before soon, like a full-grown baby coming out to world, Dre\u2019s rhymes will come out and will expose the harsh reality of the world around Dre. Dre is saying that you\u2019re not fast as he is (or was), comparing to a tortoise, a very slow animal, plus, adding that you are like in an stage of \u201cRigor Mortis\u201d that it\u2019s one of the stages that the body gets when you die.\nIn that stage the body gets stiff because of changes in the biochemistry of the muscles. In this lyric, Dre preaches that rap isn\u2019t all about making money. It\u2019s more about expressing yourself and speaking the truth, without compromise.\n\nDre also happens to now be the second richest rapper alive. Don\u2019t be a dope on stage by not doing dope. If you do, you\u2019ll just become an afterthought like all those doped-up dopes. Can\u2019t be having candy ass rappers so Dre\u2019ll just kill \u2018em all, metaphorically of course.\n\nDis = Disrespect.\ni.e. Dre has no hesitations in disrespecting those who don\u2019t have the same level of skills as him. Pepto-Bismol? The \u201csubject\u201d and \u201cpredicate\u201d are the two essential parts of a sentence. The subject of a complete sentence is who or what the sentence is about, and the predicate tells about that subject. All you need in hip-hop are sentences to tell a story rapped over some \u201cdope beats\u201d. Done well, it will not only be funky, but also make you think. A \u2018Correctional facility\u2019 is another term for jail. The sad reality for Dre is that simply expressing himself puts him in trouble with the law, such is the level of oppression where he resides.\n\nThe FBI even sent them a letter about \u201cFuck the Police\u201d.  Later,  a representative clarified that that \u201cthe bureau had no intention of suppressing N.W.A\u2019s art or free expression\u201d. Nonetheless, it stirred a public outcry because it\u2019s generally agreed that the FBI should have no influence on the direction to music.\n\nNWA was undaunted, and went on to perform the song immediately afterwards. Ice Cube told Billboard about the incident:\n\nIt was all kinds of forces against us\u2014it didn\u2019t crack us, break us, turn us into punks\u2026 It didn\u2019t make us bite our tongue. It just made us stand up even more\u2014and that\u2019s powerful. Don\u2019t sell out; don\u2019t abandon your hood roots to try and make glittery, friendly, commercial pop music. You are making a fool of yourself and will lose all the credit you\u2019ve built up in the streets.\n\nIt\u2019s a shout-out to whoever goes \u201cpop\u201d just to be more mainstream and gain more success.\nN.W.A instead keeps it real. Not, as other popular lyric sites would have it, \u201cYes, I\u2019m a cob\u201d In what was quite possibly an ironic nod to this very line, Ice Cube named his post-N.W.A group Da Lench Mob The second time in this song Dre takes a stand against using drugs that he would build his career contradicting on The Chronic and afterwards.\n\n\n\n\u201cDopeman\u201d is also the title of an anti-drug song on the album. See above for a notable example\n\nEventually NWA did get airtime for their clean version tracks thanks to Kday DJ Julio G who\u2019s credited with making gangster rap available on mainstream radio. Well, not exactly.  It\u2019s a not-exactly-hidden secret that many of Dre and Eazy\u2019s rhymes from this period were written by Cube and unofficial N.W.A member Tracy \u201cThe D.O.C.\u201d Curry O'Shea \u201cIce Cube\u201d Jackson was N.W.A\u2019s main rapper and lyricist. He would leave the group in 1989 for a successful and influential solo career and eventually find a second career as a film actor and director/writer/producer This might be the first appearance of the \u201cdo  this\u201d/\u201cBuddhist\u201d rhyme which would eventually become a common rap trope.\n\nA contemporary rhyme, but still after this one, appeared on 3rd Bass' \u201cWordz of Wizdom\u201d.  Before this one, everyone was talking about Brutus. Those \u201csome\u201d would include the Australian government, who forced the state youth radio station Triple J to stop playing N.W.A\u2019s song \u201cFuck The Police\u201d in 1989.  In protest, the station played this very song for 24 hours straight The hook (along with much of the music of the song) is sampled from the classic 1971 song not coincidentally called \u201cExpress Yourself\u201d by Charles Wright & the Watts 103rd Street Rhythm Band. OH RLLLLY!?!?!?!?!?!?\n\n\n\nSess = sensimilia = marijuana.\nThis was obviously before Dre released The Chronic, but whether he was smoking weed at the time he recorded this song is another question. Some rappers piss' em off with their shit flow, but we\u2019d just rather have Pink tickle us A pun on the common rap trope of dropping science \u2013 i.e., demonstrating wisdom or skill, and a callback to the grammar puns earlier in the verse.\n\nInterestingly,  G and Marley Marl did \u201cDroppin' Science\u201d in the same year that this song came out. At this point in the song, the music (provided by the group\u2019s DJ Yella) drops out, making the tune briefly a cappella A bit of a pun, as N.W.A styled themselves \u201cthe world\u2019s most dangerous group\u201d, and thus ruthless.  However, Ruthless was also the name of their record label, founded by group member Eazy-E and manager Jerry Heller.

DOOM is criticizing the beats of competitors by comparing their sound to being under water. Being underwater has the significance because they are more concerned about the beat as a posed to \u201c making it fun to slaughter\u201d.\nIn addition underwater could mean the over production of the music and the rappers voice that tunes to be muffled sound , almost as if they were drowning in their own music. DOOM on the other hand as stated earlier says \u201cthat beat doesn\u2019t matter at this point\u201d* speaking to the old saying that it\u2019s not the music that makes the man its the man that makes the music.

Viktor Vaughn has the greatest mass in the game, and that other emcees can only gravitate around his heavyweight lyrics. He is, in other words, the center of the game\u2019s universe. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIGxMENwq1k DOOM, or Vik, or whatever the hell you want to call him is totally reversing the common belief and rule of women and children and then men.\n\nBasically, let\u2019s say that there\u2019s a ship sinking and everyone needs to get on a lifeboat. It\u2019s a common rule for children to go first and then women and finally men. Most likely due to to the length of life ahead of children and for the fact that it\u2019s humane to save children first and then women because they are the supporters and nurturers of life. It also probably has to do with chivalry and the natural male desire to protect his own (wife and children).\n\nBack to the point though. DOOM reversed this common belief showing his chaotic villainous side. It\u2019s become common in every day language to refer to some outside source as \u201cthey.\u201d\nExample: \u201cThey say that Doom holds heat, but at the same time preaches non-violence.\u201d\n\nBut he has a point here\u2026 who IS they? A Native American leader, famous for leading an Apache uprising against the United States government in the early 1860s.\nThe name of one of the members of the gang The Warriors in the 1979 film of the same name#Cochise). The Warriors was highly influential on the generation of rappers\u2014particularly New York rappers\u2014who came of age in the 1980s, and references to the film can be heard in classic lines by Wu-Tang and Common, among others. Notably, Cochise is one of the black members of the Warriors, and dresses in a Native American outfit.\nCochise is the name of one of the police played by the Beastie Boys in the classic 1993 Spike Jonze video for Sabotage), another major influence on 1990s hip-hop. A book report is a summary version of a book. In the big scheme of things, it\u2019s a pretty easy assignment to do, so Vik is probably boasting of his proficiency and prolificness. He\u2019s talking about someone getting killed, using a common phrase for the term \u201cpopped\u201d as in shot or clapped. The comparison is drawn with popping open a bottle of beer, in this case referring to Beck\u2019s. His flows go fifty miles an hour like a vehicle. In Rastafarian mythos, Babylon is an evil empire. This is one of many references to Rastafari beliefs in the song. Could be heard as \u201cWhat the hay.\u201d A very simple pun.\n\nA \u2018hillbilly\u2019 or hick means someone who lives in a very rural area. Like the skilled villain he is, Vik is able to make a quick escape with his groupies without anyone detecting them. Again, since he\u2019s from the future, his beats are too evolved for people hearing them. #Double Entrendre\n\n\nThe groupies want to know what car (coupe) he drives\nThey want to know where he \u201cflew the coop\u201d (escaped) from\n\n\n\nalso, possibly a Back to the Future reference.\n\n\n\nHe\u2019s from the future and his time travelling device is actually is car so they have no idea what model he is driving, as it\u2019s not yet out in the past where he went back. Brooknam is a portmanteau of Brooklyn and Vietnam, referring to the bloodshed in both places. In Brooklyn, it\u2019s newsworthy when a day goes by when someone is not murdered. Vik still has passion for rhyming and raps with substance.\n\nRhyming into the mic with substance is equated to physically spitting phlegm onto the mic\n\n\n\nSimilar concept to this line:\n\nHe spit on the mic, yuck, saliva\n\u2013 Viktor Vaughn, Saliva  The reference to his blazing sword and the police robeast are from the 80s/90s cartoon Voltron. It\u2019s common to refer to police as \u201cthe beast\u201d, but here Vik puts his own 1980s-nostalgia spin on the line.\n\nSee below for blazing sword:-\n\n\n\nAnd now for the Robeast, one of Voltron\u2019s arch-enemies. This G cleans the scuff marks on his Timberlands with a nail file. Stan Smith is a tenniser that lent his name to a type of shoe made by Adidas. Vik wore \u2018em with some fresh checkerboard laces. Weird G that kept to himself as a kid.\n\nReference to the lonely kid stereotype, throwing a ball against his garage wall and catching it again. Reference to the career of Dr. Doom, who combined his scientific training with an intensive study of black magic in order to become the world\u2019s premier supervillain. Beck\u2019s is a brand of beer.\n\nHops is what is used to give beer its chracteristic flavour. Alternatively, can be interpreted as hopper, a means to address youngsters in the hood.\nNeck chopping is a reference to the \u2018lyrical swordsmanship\u2019 metaphor that the Wu Tang popularized with songs like Protect Ya Neck\n\nDrop refers to this song and his gun and the head dropping of a neck Those must be some whack beats son, if this is ^ your only option Homage to Can' Ox. Alludes to the opening and closing of the original Star Trek, when the captain (Kirk) would enter the episodes happenings into the Captain\u2019s Log. Another creative word for the grass Viktor doesn\u2019t listen to anyone, he\u2019s on his own dick. (See previous line.) Any other influence than his own would corrupt his excellence. All swine is a reference to pigs, which is a reference to the police who Viktor says mess up his nefarious plans, much like a blind person posted as a lookout would (because he can\u2019t see anything, he\u2019s pretty much useless as a lookout). DOOM wraps up the references to the movies \u201cJuice\u201d and \u201cBelly\u201d from the lines before.\n\nDOOM is saying rappers are too influenced by gangster movies A reference to the 1940s gangster movie \u201cWhite Heat\u201d (starring James Cagney) that the main crew in the 1992 movie \u201cJuice\u201d watches with great interest. Bishop, played by Tupac, is clearly influenced by this viewing. DOOM seems to have a penchant for providing water for the fine young female kin of men.\n\nMowgli know what it do\u2026\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta1mzaqOp4Q This line is true on different levels:\n\n\nIt is better off going corporate, or selling out, in the game, if money is your objective. In this teaser for the Forbes Hip-Hop Cash Kings of 2012 list, there are absolutely zero underground artists whose names were dropped.\nThe subject matter of corporate-controlled hip-hop has a far more poppy, bouncy sound than that of underground rap, where the creative control lies within the artist. Just compare the drastic difference between the beats and subject matter of the current top ten hip-hop/R&B songs for the week of September 1st, 2012, and that of this MF DOOM song, for example. Hes joking around with the fact that hip-hop has gone bad and is now controlled by the freaks, and its turned into a show\u2026 hes also saying don\u2019t get caught up in the drama of the \u201cshow\u201d On a good night, he rocks the crowd out to the point where hoes fight over him. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ycy5RybTjd0&t=0m45s Doom reminding everyone that the next catchy hook you hear, might be a line he wrote and sold to some sucka MC. Doom just concerns himself with making money, and lets the rest of his life fall into place.  Vik believes his customer is new to the rap game as evidenced by the type of hooks (catchy phrases to draw in listeners) that he buys. Apparently only amateur rhymers go in for them. An easy comparison would be seeing some kid shell out for those CD beat librarys you can get off Ebay instead of digging for his own breaks. Lets you know you\u2019re dealing with a Newjack. Vik has a mind to make love to your Daughter, and in this way she\u2019s gonna get \u201clucky,\u201d which is only \u201csorta\u201d like luckily finding a quarter\u2026\n\nEither way, she\u2019s bending over\u2026 Dealing with record labels is akin to a robbery gone wrong\u2013in both cases someone\u2019s gonna wind up dead and it wont be part of the plan\u2026 Ensign is the military rank for a junior officer, so Viktor is saying he should of asked his higher ranking officers (upperclassmen) before he shot them DOOM\u2019s obscure slang selections are too deep to be recognized by most. DOOM creates a play on words with the term \u201cprints\u201d (the stage is like a crime scene, he leaves no fingerprints) and the artist \u201cPrince\u201d as he parallels Prince to Michael Jackson (\u201cMike\u201d and his famous glove), as they were popular rivals in the 80\u2019s. Most rappers now a days don\u2019t take hip hop seriously. They treat it as a part-time hobby rather than a skilled craft. In Frank 151, Alex Threadgold, \u2018one of the executive producers of Vaudeville Villain\u2019, explains:\n\nOn the surface, it\u2019s one of several Star Trek references on the record. On another level, Enterprise was the company I used to book a van from every time we scheduled a week of recording. Mad basic, but I was the dude tasked to handle that shit! The lyric is actually referring to the Mexican soda beverage Jarrito, which is usually found in predominately Latino communities. In the hands of Dumile, the Mic is a deadly weapon.  In the movie Krull, the main character had a hand held blade that he would throw like a boomerang and kill his enemies. There\u2019s a lot of bark and no bite dudes. He compares perhaps a crew of criminals to rappers in general who talk a lot of talk but don\u2019t actually live the life they talk about Method Man, playing Ike Love in the 1998 film Belly, says this exact line.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EAl4HQTlnQ DOOM is comparing these bitch niggas to catchers in baseball, who stand behind the batter and sometimes talk trash.\n\nNote that Catcher in the Rye is the favorite book of many assassins who have shot their idols \u2014 including Mark David Chapman. MC Lyte\u2019s I Cram To Understand U meets a Rastafarian term meaning understanding at a higher level of consciousness. Also see use of the word \u2018Babylon\u2019 later on. A macabre line, but one with some sense in light of hip-hop\u2019s violent history \u2013 those who kill hip-hop\u2019s icons tend to be fans of the music.\n\nMark David Chapman may have something to say about that, though A play on words that uses the word \u201csave\u201d in two very different senses \u2013 Vik wants to \u201csave\u201d the rap game by rescuing it from corny bubblegum rappers and fake gangsters, just as you used to \u201csave\u201d a video game by storing your data on a memory card. Mind your own business or bring your own stretcher A predatory race in Star Trek, connecting to the references below (Enterprise, Klingons).\n\nAnother predatory race If he\u2019s not workin, or on the street selling merchandise or pan handling, he\u2019s masturbating.\n\nThe word bleeped out is ostensibly \u201cgherkin\u201d (aka. pickle).\n\nThe phrase \u201cPutting work in\u201d is a very common term amongst gangs meaning to do crimes that benefit the gang such as stealing and killing.

Travel Fox is a brand of shoe.\n\n\n\nVik is telling you that you\u2019re getting stomped for your \u201cdrysnitchin'\u201d. Joe Piscopo was a popular comedian in the early 1980s, known mostly for his work on the \u201cEddie Murphy Era\u201d of *Saturday Night Live.\"\n\n\n\nIn the late \u201880s, Piscopo became a body builder (\u201ccock diesel\u201d). That\u2019s why they\u2019re acting like there\u2019s gonna be a fight. They\u2019re acting all suspicious Vik\u2019s gon' get an allergic reaction and blank out, however, courteous as always he thanks his dear friend. A probable reference to the tv show Murder, She Wrote, where at the end of every show a the middle-aged protagonist would sign her name in calligraphy on the murder stories she was writing / solving.\n\nIn these lines, it\u2019s Vik signing off after murdering the track.\n\n\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqhEIb-qQbs boxing reference before you even think of rapping get your rap game right G reference to the days when promo records meant something play the promo in which hip hop heads where anxious to hear DOOM is older than most of these \u201cgangsta rappers\u201d who claim to shoot shit up now they are all grown up they claim to be hard core As in Biz Markie finger foods  V needs to pop a zantac to slow dow the rapid effects of the heartburn\n\n\n\nAlso, note: \u201cOck\u201d suggests both \u201coctaroon\u201d, a not uncommon dimunitive for a fellow Afro-American, and Dr. Doom\u2019s fellow Marvel villain, Dr. Octopus (who else would get DOOM his prescriptions?) from Stan Lee\u2019s Spiderman Serves a double purpose:\n\n\nVik is here, defying incredible odds\nVik is a natural-born wordsmith, possessing invaluable powers of persuasion and charisma. He is a silver-tongued villain that could easily seduce you to believe an obviously dishonest person. As explained by Alex Threadgold in Frank 151:\n\nI remember another time talking about trivia from growing up in New York and we laughed about Dr. Zizmor, the dermatologist who\u2019s had ads on local TV and in the subway forever. I\u2019d just seen his \u201cfruit peels\u201d exposed as a sham on the news. DOOM must\u2019ve liked the idea that Zizmor was supposedly a scientist, but he was kind of a snake-oil salesman, too\u2014just like Vik. Hence the reference to the good doctor in the RJD2-produced \u201cSaliva.\u201d\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUNAwGIIv48 All the ladies called him Vaughny she drinks a lot (like a fish), to the point where it ought to be her star sign (clever hyperbole) He\u2019ll crush your reality He came from some shit, i.e. grew up in a tough neighborhood. A reference to a commercial campaign for Polaner All Fruit \u201cSpreadable Fruit\u201d preserves.\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xBydH93eDY Refers to a gun with a silencer\n\n\n\nHow, you ask? The neck of Bacardi 151 bottle (and other high-proof drinks) normally houses a flame arrestor/suppressor to prevent too much alcohol from being pour onto an ignition source. Similarly, a gun silencer quiets a gun by containing the explosion it emits, sonically speaking. Whats your name (on the CB). In the previous line, Vik promised to shove his sneaker down your throat. He continues the thought here, suggesting that the shoe will go through your stomach to be digested. Of course you\u2019re a coward, so your stomach is a \u201cyellow belly.\u201d Citizen Band radios are commonly used by truckers.\n\n\n\nBasically, Vik holds the mic close and with deep familiarity. Vaugn has never steered away from trouble, or lost on purpose Thick, meaning bootylicious.\n\nDOOM says about this line, and being Viktor Vaughn, in XXL Magazine:\n\n\nIt\u2019s a little more vulgar than DOOM would be. That\u2019s the obvious thing you can tell. Viktor say whatever the fuck is on his mind. It\u2019s a no holds barred type of thing. DOOM on the other hand is a little more reserved and watches what he says. He\u2019s trying to be grammatically correct, politically correct, and cover all angles. Vik speaks from a heart place. It just has more testosterone. He\u2019s a young whippersnapper so he talks shit.\n\nI change for the character, but the style existed before the character. I had the style and I knew I was going to place it to a character. Once I placed that style to the character, it changed. It\u2019s a different attitude. It\u2019s easy to reach back to the DOOM style. They all exist in me, so it\u2019s just a matter of placing them, putting certain rhymes with that character. It\u2019s an allusion to the Waynes world \u201csphincter says what\u201d joke, getting the person to respond \u201cwhat\u201d and therefore justifying what they were called They\u2019ll want to get the taste out of their mouth Yoke is the piece of wood that keeps animals from being able to escape. Here he\u2019s suggesting that they should hold him by the neck until Vaughn can get there\n\nIf slaves tried to run while working fields, The Plantation owners were known to Yoke them by putting a Board across their shoulders and wrapping a rope tightly around their arms. Then it was very difficult for them to run. Crews acting like gangsters when they\u2019re really quite soft. He spits (raps) on the mic, but literally spits on it, so people say yuk, saliva Hard to see this as anything but irony in light of the DOOMposter phenomenon.\n\n\n\nViktor doesn\u2019t like DOOM as evidenced on Fancy Clown\n\nwhen you see tin-head tell him be duckin' down.\n\nSo here Viktor is effectively dissing DOOM for using stand-ins. The irony is that Dumile is acknowledging it. Vik cleverly connects a traditional metaphor for shooting (\u201csmoked\u201d) to a traditional metaphor for fighting (\u201cbeef\u201d). He leaves rival emcees hanging (as though from a gallows), but describes this using a play on the word \u201cleave him hanging,\u201d as in letting someone extend their hand for a low-five without providing the expected dap. You are more likely to leave someone hanging if you doubt their hygiene. Note the pun, \u201cjust for kicks,\u201d with reference to the Asics gel shoes.\n\n\n\nAlso he\u2019s using \u201cgel\u201d as in shoes as a homonym for \u201cjealous\u201d. Note that this line concerns saliva. Scoliosis is a disorder that leads to a curved spine, which combines the slang terms \u201cplaying the back\u201d (being quiet, studying others) and \u201cstaying bent\u201d (high on drugs and ready for malice). To \u201cshuck and jive\u201d is to slyly, passively dissemble or avoid accomplishing some task; it was a way of \u201cbeing\u201d associated with blacks under slavery and in the Jim Crow South, who didn\u2019t dare refuse orders from white superiors, but who might passively avoid complying by, e.g., going about the job slowly or pretending not to understand.\n\nDespite its origins as a mode of passive resistance, shucking and jiving is viewed as anachronistic, embarrassing behavior today by most blacks, a relic of a time when blacks were viewed as an inferior caste.\n\nDOOM has long been fascinated by taboo images of black servility; thus the original cover art for KMD\u2019s Black Bastards (1994) featured a Sambo character being hung.\n\nBelow, the actor Stepin Fetchit, who is (along with Bill \u201cBojangles\u201d Robinson) the most prominent shucker and jiver in the American popular imagination.  A character (played by Kevin Smith) from Clerks and Jay & Silent Bob Strike Back who (as his names suggests) never speaks. If you keep talking shit you\u2019ll get punched in the mouth. His mother (old Earth) knows him the best. Vik don\u2019t like skinny women. As he states below, he\u2019s \u201cnever met a chick, that was too thick for\u201d him.

A ditty is a short, simple song. At 2:31 this song is the average length and is far from simple. Could be a drug reference in that key often can refer to a kilo of a substance, marijuana or cocaine.  But it could also be a reference to music, in that a key is the set of notes that go with a particular tune.\n\nCould also be a physical key \u2013 calling up to his girl in their apartment in the last line, asking her to throw the door key down to him so that he can get in. He\u2019s burnt-out (exhausted) due to working so much throughout the summer, but now that work (making music) finally pays off.\n\n\u2018Every edgy penny\u2019 \u2013 here he uses the word edgy to mean \u2018dodgy\u2019 or \u2018dubious\u2019 to infer that he\u2019s making money illegally. #triple entendre.\n- It didn\u2019t rain that summer\n- Vik had no money that summer\n- Vik stayed sober that summer, (perhaps combined with the above) or the local drug supply ran dry\n\nThe fact that he says \u201cas far as I remember\u201d may suggest that he actually did drink alcohol that summer. #triple entendre.\n- A musical/theatrical act he\u2019s performing, playing off the \u201cvaudeville\u201d theme.\n- \u201c\u00a1Ay, caramba!\u201d is his catch-phrase (frequently repeated, characteristic).\n- Vik gave away his telephone number. (Playing off the previous line)\n\n\u201c\u00a1Ay, caramba!\u201d is an exclamation used in Spanish to denote surprise (usually positive). #triple entendre.\n- They challenge Vik to a fight because he\u2019s got cash on him.\n- If you want to meet Vik you\u2019ll have to pay him in cash for it.\n- They act like they\u2019re friends because Vik\u2019s got cash on him. #triple entendre.\nVik is schooling a younger kid:\n\n\nBecome a better rapper and you\u2019ll be able to stand out on your songs. (\u201cLight up a track\u201d)\nSmoke a joint/blunt with me and I\u2019ll give you knowledge through conversation.\nMoney isn\u2019t what\u2019s important, so today\u2019s lesson will be to burn some dollar bills. (Playing off the previous line) Vik is like King Midas, i.e. everything he touches turns to gold. #double entendre.\n(\u201cDutch\u201d is a slang term for a joint, or a blunt.)\n\n\nLight up a marijuana cigarette like the Dutch (people of the Netherlands) do when they feel like smoking some hashish. Hash comes in the form of brown blocks that must be literally melted with a flame before it can be rolled and smoked.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLight dollar bills on fire like you would light a joint/blunt. (Playing off the previous line)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDutch people:  native to The Netherlands.  Capital:  Amsterdam, worldwide legal marijuana meca.  Dutch Masters:  cheap cigar great for rolling blunts.\n\nAlso, hash is more prevalent in Europe than the U.S.  It\u2019s very common to roll a joint, blunt, or tobacco cigarette with hash (at least in Espa\u00f1a). The Ace of spades is known as the \u201cdeath card\u201d and was used by the US Army during WWII and the Vietnam War. Either worn on a battle helmet or placed on dead enemies.\n\n\n\n\n\n#triple entendre.\n- The best king dies. (\u201cAce\u201d = the best at something)\n- Don\u2019t fuck with Vik, he\u2019ll destroy even the strongest opponent. (\u201cAce king\u201d = Kill the king)\n- Don\u2019t deal Vik an ace of spades, it\u2019s like giving him a death threat. (Vik is a king and the ace of spades is known as the death card. The death card in Tarot decks display a skeleton riding a horse, with a dead king underneath.) Rappers talking too much about their criminal endeavours and incriminating themselves.\n\nThis is the whole concept of Rapp Snitch Knishes on Mm.. Food. Catchphrase of the Fonz from Happy Days\n\nIt\u2019s like he really was a white belt\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lA_hNoGDM4Y Right before he knocked him the fuck out, he asked him how he liked being conscious. When people have near-death experiences they often report moving \u201ctowards the light\u201d or something similar\u2013Viktor is asking his opponent how that light feels after bringing them near death.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWoxOwpXPcI He thinks the ish they be bangin' is so weak that he wouldn\u2019t even take it for free\u2026 This fictional rapper he is talking about claims that he is good in karate, but in reality he\u2019s just a weak-ass white belt (lowest training in karate). Therefore, Viktor had no problem laying him out. When rappers spit pre-written bars, it\u2019s called flipping the script. Daniel Dumile apparently has notebooks full of lyrics.\n\nRob Reiner is the director of films like When Harry Met Sally and A Few Good Men.\n\nThe way DOOM spits his lyrics can be compared to how a director brings a movie script to life. Here, Doom means \u201csick\u201d in a literal sense, as opposed to its colloquial understanding.  Normally, saying \u201cya man sick\u201d mean\u2019s he\u2019s nice on the mic, but by using the conjunction \u201cbut\u201d, he reveals in fact the opposite.  Ya man sick (messed up in the head) but he wreck tracks (metaphorical interpretation).  If \u201csick\u201d were meant as a colloquial, you would use the \u201cand\u201d conjunction instead of the \u201cbut\u201d as in: Ya man SICK! \u2026 AND he wreck tracks! To strong-arm is to use physical force.\nIf you try to punch Vik then you should watch out for that left hook (boxing term for left arm punch) that\u2019ll inevitably be coming at you. Cowardly MC\u2019s should speak less.\n\nTo \u2018mellow out\u2019 usually entails one \u2018calming down\u2019.\n\nV doesn\u2019t mind the fact that you rhyme, it\u2019s what you rhyme about that upsets him.  Basically, enough with the tough guy act.  Mellow out.\n\nMelo out\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RarOfZP6c3M Today\u2019s MC\u2019s short lived rhymes are usually just draw from movie scenes, as opposed to actual life experiences. Hokuto Shinken and Nanto Suich\u014d Ken are two rival martial arts styles from the Japanese anime Fist of the North Star. To name some mentionable people, he mentions that he is a big fan of Dan Aykroyd, the guy who acted in and wrote Ghostbusters (and did a lot of other shit too) He\u2019ll use karate to beat a rappers ass and wonders what they\u2019ve been doing while he was training What happened to rapping about shit that will help someone instead of stupid shit like shooting people? Listen to some of the shit off of K.M.D.\u2019s first album, Mr. Hood (1991), and you\u2019ll see what he means. He not only doesn\u2019t think these kids couldn\u2019t deal with jail, but they couldn\u2019t even handle the holding cell (where they put you before you go to D-block or your actual cell (which sucks balls btw)) MCs these days will do anything to get some cash, and Vik doesn\u2019t care about them.\n\nKnuckle-fuck is a term used to denote a fucking knucklehead like fuck-tard stands for fucking retard. It could also mean that he loves punching them out, in other words, they are only good for pleasing his knuckles.\n\nKnuckle-fuck could also be interpreted literally meaning fucking one\u2019s knuckles/hand, meaning these dudes are a bunch of jerk-offs or wankers. Some of these rappers are so bad they suck dick The intentional double negative is an interesting subtext to the message in the line itself.\n\nInstead of saying \u201cI care about who cares about me\u201d, Dumile posits the opposite of the statement and uses a double negative. He\u2019s actually saying he doesn\u2019t care who\u2019s feeling him. Essentially, \u201cI don\u2019t care who\u2019s feeling me,\u201d establishing the individual nature of Viktor. Viktor Vaughn introduces himself with some alliteration, while also alluding to the loose time-traveling plot of the album.\n\nThis line also presents an immediate title drop.\n\nVaudeville was a theatrical genre of variety entertainment popular in the United States and Canada from the early 1880s until the early 1930s. A vaudeville performer is often referred to as a vaudevillian. \u201cYak\u201d is a slang term for cognac and for cocaine.\n\nVik takes on the persona of a drug dealer, but  it is not clear, however, why Vik calls his client Horshack, the name of an especially goofy character from the TV show Welcome Back, Kotter. An epithet for New York, after the 1948 film which originated the phrase \u201cthere are eight million stories in the naked city.\u201d Bill Murray and Steve Martin were among the prominent 1980s comedians to have dances named after them in the black community. An allusion to the great African-American author Richard Wright, whose autobiography was titled Black Boy (1945), and whose novel Native Son (1940) featured a main character named Bigger Thomas. Vaughn\u2019s opponents swagger around as though they are practically invincible, like Marvel superhero Wolverine who is famous for being able to recover from even serious injuries almost instantaneously.\n\nIn fact they are not Wolverines but \u201cmonkeys\u201d, and will not easily recover from the blows that Vaughn inflicts.\n\nIn Batty Boyz DOOM talks some more about these superhero rappers. The Van Wyck Expressway (I-678) runs through Queens and the Bronx. Riding down it on horseback would be quite a feat, to say nothing of reaching speeds of 80 mph on a horse. Reginald Denny, a white truck driver, was viciously beaten by a gang of black assailants, reacting angrily to the acquittal of several police officers in the Rodney King trial.\n\nLike the King incident, Denny\u2019s beating was filmed in real time. A jury eventually acquitted his accused assailants on all but a handful of minor charges.

This could be a reference to cigars/blunts and/or chocolate thai weed\n\n\n\nSure do look like chocolate fingers especially when packaged This should be viewed in conjunction with the line that follows.\n\nIn the original donkey kong game \u2013 The monkey was the villain and Mario had to knock his monkey ass out of the proverbial \u2018frame\u2019 \u2013 since hand helds were 2d games on a very small screen that was similar to a picture frame. This is a reference to the nerdy alter ego of Spiderman, Peter Parker. Of course, Viktor Vaughn is the alter ego of arguably Spiderman\u2019s biggest nemesis: DOOM.\n\nIt would only make sense for Vik to cheat his exams with a little help from spidey. Thanks to Alex Threadgold, for explaining in Frank151:\n\nMy favorite buried treasure comes in \u201cNever Dead,\u201d a whole extended story about mixing hard science with incantations. Outwardly, [this line] is about (ahem) teen drinking. But if you parse the sounds a different way you get, \u201cGrey Goo scenario,\u201d a hypothesis where nano-technology self-replicates and takes over the world. The guy who first wrote about it described a bottle as the breeding ground. We had all just read about it in a Scientific American issue that was floating around the studio.\n\nGrey Goose is a brand of vodka, by the way. Vik is meant to be a younger, more immature, grossly overconfident DOOM \u2013 He appears to be of an adolescent age.\n\nThis is a great play on words \u2013 He goes to school every day except when he cuts class. But even then, he is still on the \u2018books\u2019. A bookie runs illegal betting games, so he is still doing math and running odds and numbers. The proper way of downing shots of tequila outside of Mexico is by licking salt off your hand, taking a shot and then sucking on a slice of tequila; the tequila cruda.\n\nYou also have the tequila suicide. This is done by snorting the salt, drinking the tequila and then squeezing lime juice in your eye. V had his game stolen out of his locker earlier in this song. But now, Curt comes back to school and sees Viktor, and Vik tells him that he finally got the game back from them damn 9th graders. Curtis Strifer is one M. Sayyid\u2019s aliases. King Gilizwe was DJ Subroc, MF DOOM\u2019s little brother with whom he used to rap with under KMD. The nickname King Gilizwe comes from Subroc\u2019s first name Dingilizwe. Not sure exactly what V means, but some kids used to freeze bugs to put them in a stasis, only to tie fishing line around them. When they thaw out, it\u2019s like they have a little pet.\n\nIt\u2019s also a metaphor/double entendre. Weed smokers also refer to a \u2018roach\u2019 as the bit just before the weed runs out (there is also an increased chance of getting burned). When the roach is done, what most smokers say is \u2018dead it\u2019 or the roach is dead i.e. there isn\u2019t any more weed in it. This is playing on the radio in V\u2019s ride, time travelled to the 50s I guess:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEllHMWkXEU \u2026buying some explosive firecrackers, a carton of bullets and some girls. And before the casing hits the ground, V is halfway across town in Chinatown\u2026 There\u2019s nothing sweeter than hearing a 9mm gun pop off. If you had one of these back in the early 80s you\u2019d be pissed too! Sounds like Vic and Sayyid were playin with some kind of crazy vodou/Santer\u00eda time travel magic\u2026 Ed Koch was mayor of New York when Vaughn was in high school, and presumably liked to be kept informed of the budding young rapper\u2019s beefs. Another Transformers reference\u2026 Starscream is a notorious traitor who always turns on the Decepticons (who are the bad guys). #!!!

Mos Def will be the only one in control of his thoughts and actions once this is over. Instead of being confused by two opposing personalities Mos Def will become one defining person once he eliminates the part of him that he despises.  Two parts of Mos Def\u2019s personality are at constant odds so even though they are essentially the same person Mos Def is killing off some part of himself.

Mac always falls for a girl, but he never follows through on being in a commitment with someone. Mac made all of his money by being original and creative. That\u2019s his motto and he will always stand by that. Mac doesn\u2019t have the patience to wait. There is always something he could be doing, so he is barely ever waiting around. Mac doesn\u2019t care what he has to do, he is going to live out his dreams. He\u2019s rappin for his people in Pittsburgh. Macs been around the world. Just free your mind and let Mac\u2019s music take you over. Let him show you something beyond what you know. Whenever Mac is in the car he\u2019s rolling a combo of weed and tobacco.

In fact, many musicians smoke weed while in the studio, some claim it enables them to make better music. Mac is on the road an can only watch his city from the news. All the doctors attempts to heal the sick are impossible. Might be the reason he donated 50K to the Make-A-Wish Foundation. Mac wants to let the city know that its all for them; and hes going to stay in touch and occasionally give charity. Quoting the famous line from the song \u201cLeaving On A Jet Plane\u201d by Slighty Stoopid. Mac can\u2019t stand all these people who front their lives, and uses \u201cbig words\u201d to describe his feelings like a true \u201cintellectual\u201d.\n\nAlso, The High Life was his 3rd released mixtape and the mixtape where this track is on. Mac\u2019s always eager to come back to Pittsburgh. And by hook or by crook, he\u2019s going to do that, as a promise to come back and see his girl. Mac describes Pittsburgh\u2019s embracing of him as he lands in his hometown as love-filled and hard to reject, but he has to force himself to separate himself from \u201cher\u201d because he needs the money. In these lines Mac gives us a play-by-play of his long car ride, and it sounds eerily similar to the beginning of \u201cShe Said\u201d Pittsburgh is personified as a girl Mac loves who has to leave for touring\u2026sounds a lot like that Kanye song\u2026 "},{"album": {"api_path": "/albums/11737", "name": "Finally Famous Vol. 2: UKNOWBIGSEAN", "artist": {"name": "Big Sean", "url": "http://genius.com/artists/Big-sean", "iq": 5516.0, "image_url": "https://images.rapgenius.com/7c7b94de55bcdbd9cfa5208e21667864.1000x667x1.jpg", "is_verified": true, "id": 492}, "url": "http://genius.com/albums/Big-sean/Finally-famous-vol-2-uknowbigsean", "cover_art_url": "https://images.rapgenius.com/35094fe912ce98af36fb55bca8412d23.500x500x1.jpg", "id": 11737}, "song_id": 6155, "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 3, "transcribers": 0, "contributors": 3, "iq_earners": 3, "accepted_annotations": 10, "hot": false, "verified_annotations": 0}, "artist": {"name": "Big Sean", "url": "http://genius.com/artists/Big-sean", "iq": 5516.0, "image_url": "https://images.rapgenius.com/7c7b94de55bcdbd9cfa5208e21667864.1000x667x1.jpg", "is_verified": true, "id": 492}, "pyongs_count": null, "title": "Desire Want and Need", "annotations": "?

The cliche goes \u201cI\u2019d kill for ____\u201d, which is an exaggeration for the desire for something. To have the life Sean has, people would kill for it. Big artists (no pun intended) usually charge a price for a feature verse.

Arabic phrase commonly used by Muslims, meaning \u201cGod is great\u201d.

Tech is uncontrollable and wild like his leash is broken. The darkness is taking over him, filling him from the inside. There is so much of it that it literally comes out.\nAs in K.O.D., Tech is saying that darkness \u201cclouded his soul\u201d, which means he lets us see the dark side of him, not the usual Mr.Yates we know Tech having a big head(as people say)\nHe will not stop until he\u2019s on top, because he knows he can take over the world with his music. What Tech means is that he\u2019s seeping out pure darkness.\n\nYou can see darkness leaking out Tech\u2019s eye on the cover of the EP \u201cSeepage\u201d, and if you pay attention to the cover of the \u201cK.O.D\u201d CD (New 2009) you can see some darkness leaking out on his arms/hands, you can also see alot of darkness coming out from Tech\u2019s head on his last EP \u201cBoiling Point\u201d (New 2012) where the darkness is just boiling over.\n\nTech\u2019s explaining these Three covers by himself here:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovYKTnjofK4\nHe explains it after 03:10 minutes in this inteview. A double meaning, he is an odd person and the \u201ceven odd\u201d plays on the \u201cAll 6\u2019s and 7\u2019s\u201d in the next line He can feel how the darkness within him is overflowing and starting to seep out making him feel sick, it\u2019s a little bit of a reference to a the male ejaculation (touch it, feel it, love it, seepage) may refer to ejaculation since Tech is \u201cobsessed\u201d with sex Reference to then-upcoming mixtape, Bad Season.\nSince Tech is the King of Darkness, he\u2019s bad\u2026 BAD SEASON! Tech N9ne is \u201cseeping\u201d (it\u2019s falling down) out his sickness and anger over the average pop songs out today. He is getting rid of any credibility these dumb pop artists might have had. People who have talking bad about Tech have no clue what they are talking about. This is a reiteration stating since he put out the Mixed Plate, people have been trying to put him down saying he\u2019s lost his talent, but this EP proves he hasn\u2019t lost anything. The Gates Mixed Plate was a \u201cCollabos\u201d album Tech released as rejoice of all the good things that have been going on in his life. But the CD didn\u2019t please his fans as much as his dark projects have, so they said he sold out and fell off. This EP is a testament to how ON he really is and how far away he is from falling off. People try to say that Tech will sell out once he sees the money. What they don\u2019t is that he\u2019s already making the money (Strange Music is valued around $70 million\u2026) and he\u2019s still spitting as raw as ever, proven on this track. Nonetheless, the critics are still blinded by their hate. Tech N9ne, born Aaron Dontez Yates, is stuck in the bad moments he has had. Negativity surrounds him in this time of his life. Kansas City and its music scene is expanding on everybody\u2019s radar because of Tech N9ne. It is \u201ccrawling\u201d on the \u201cmap\u201d He let the K.O.D. (King of Darkness) out, and now the K.O.D. is recording music.\nIt\u2019s weird, though, because \u201cPhallus\u201d is a word of Greek/Latin origin meaning the \u201cpenis\u201d, \u201cclitoris\u201d or any sexual embryonic organ. Tech has called his lust weaknesses \u201cdemons\u201d in many songs. So, it is interesting in seeing how dark Tech considers sex to be. His concern of K.O.D. and the darkness has shrunken so Tech is letting it out fully KOD = King Of Darkness\nK.O.D. is Tech\u2019s darkest album to date, in which this EP, Seepage, is a continuation of.\n\n\n\nTech also plays with this line because it sounds like he\u2019s asking \u201cDo you believe in God?\u201d. Tech said it himself that he has a God Complex Tech will not stop till he\u2019s known world wide. He is keeping himself OUTSIDE of the \u201cbox\u201d Oxymoron between being POSITIVE about a NEGATIVE future. Tech N9ne is a high-tempered, angry motherfucker Awake the anger and make the crowd go insane. Tech N9ne\u2019s shows are known for their wild mosh pits. Sodom and Gomorrah are Biblical cities mentioned in the book of Genesis. In Christian and Islamic traditions, Sodom and Gomorrah have become synonymous with impenitent sin, and their fall with a proverbial manifestation of God\u2019s wrath.\nSince Mr. N9ne calls himself the \u201cKing of Darkness\u201d, it would make sense that he would be in the middle of these cities of sin. This is a reference to Tech\u2019s then-upcoming album All 6\u2019s and 7\u2019s.\nAlso referring to himself as good and evil. 6 is the number representative of evil, and 7 is the number representative of godliness.\n\n\n\nDon\u2019t forget to notice the chronological order references of his projects: K.O.D. (2009), Bad Season (2010), All 6\u2019s And 7\u2019s (2011) He is the King of DARKNESS A lot of other rappers that were around when Tech was around have sold out. Their music \u201crotted\u201d and went \u201cpop\u201d for the mainstream. He compares this transition to burning hot sausages. Tech\u2019s flows are so amazing that they\u2019ll make the world explode (i.e. Worldwide Choppers) Tech N9ne has 3 personas, one of which is \u201cThe Clown\u201d. So Tech is saying that everybody has been calling for him lately.

If anybody tries to better Los he will kill everyone and stack their limbs in piles Los has been told he is magnificent and excellent and it\u2019s getting boring to hear Los is calling out rappers who aren\u2019t who they say they are in their raps and can\u2019t imagine how they are more successful than him and those that are more successful will get killed Los using a play on words to boast about how great he is. He is not on the BENCH, like a basketball player who isn\u2019t very good, but he\u2019s the BENCHmark, which means he sets a standard. At the time that this song was released he was unsigned.\n\nHe says he\u2019s building a bathroom because people take shits in bathrooms, but shit in this sense actually refers to musical content. Despite being unsigned, he still put out new music. Here los plays on the words principal/principle, and he is saying that he is the head honcho of the rap game, and he refers to himself as the \u201cprincpal\u201d, because people in a school this case\"rap game\" he is not tested. But he is stressing the \u201cprinciple\u201d of the situation, which is that he cannot be touched. Big Brother Los was mentioned to be in the XXL Freshmen Class but Los is no freshmen and has been doing this for a while Los is slept on and thinks he should be in the top 5 Los is killin' rappers and burying them LeBron plays with the Heat, Heat is also known as a gun. Rappers carry a gun and are afraid to shoot, LeBron plays with a all star team and is still afraid to shoot. Photoshop CAN be deceiving\u2026 XXL turned him down on the 2011 XXL Freshman, so they did the same shit every label did, just on a different day. In the show Family Matters, there is a(n) episode where Steve Urkel (nerd) creates a bot using his knowledge. So, when Los says \u201cShe give me brains I come to life, bitch I\u2019m Urkel bot\u201d He means that Urkel used his brains to bring the bot to life. Travis Porter, the artist has a song called \u201cMake It Rain\u201d he\u2019s saying that he\u2019s so fly and has connections that he got the shoes a year before they are supposed to be released it\u2019s a mix of wordplay and pattern rap and what he is saying that he\u2019s to raw to be square and then he goes off to describe icecube being square and put inside trey and the trey being inside a box then he say\u2019s he will but square nigga in box(casket) with his trey and therefore they are ice cubes and it could also be a reference to the rapper ice cube because on one of his lp cover hewas in morgue with a person with a toe tag he\u2019s saying that niggas might call this amazing but he came up with this when he woke up and pretty much saying this was nuthin compared to what he really could do a play words seeing as travis barker isa drummer who beats and he\u2019s beating around the Bush( george w. bush) while he visits the white house "},{"album": {"api_path": "/albums/431", "name": "Insomnia, Vol. 1", "artist": {"name": "Asheru", "url": "http://genius.com/artists/Asheru", "iq": 1208.0, "image_url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/rapgenius/1363876217_Asheru.jpg", "is_verified": true, "id": 2193}, "url": "http://genius.com/albums/Asheru/Insomnia-vol-1", "cover_art_url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/rapgenius/jdsaW.gif", "id": 431}, "song_id": 6159, "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 18, "transcribers": 0, "contributors": 5, "iq_earners": 5, "accepted_annotations": 3, "hot": false, "verified_annotations": 0}, "artist": {"name": "Asheru", "url": "http://genius.com/artists/Asheru", "iq": 1208.0, "image_url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/rapgenius/1363876217_Asheru.jpg", "is_verified": true, "id": 2193}, "pyongs_count": null, "title": "Revolution", "annotations": "? Asheru wants Hip-Hop to grow from just a genre of music to something educational that helps the youth Asheru admits that he is a conscious artist but not completely Don\u2019t let the powers that be (e.g the government, the media, the corporate etc.) tell you shit that\u2019s fake but you do research yourself and find out what\u2019s really real Some shit that you\u2019ve said or done is not how you really feel You shouldn\u2019t piss people off just as you shouldn\u2019t be fake Asheru wants to reap the fruits of his labor and is looking for alternative means to get rich. For Asheru, the bar has been set so low that anything that\u2019s against the mainstream sound is being labeled as \u2018conscious music\u2019. Artists such as Common & Mos Def can attest to that. According to Asheru, just rapping about the real shit isn\u2019t enough to qualify as \u2018conscious\u2019 Any thing that has the potential to stop the endless cycle of violence and truancy in the songs is rejected by society Then, society blames the youth for their behavior while the artists that wrote the songs get away with the money and ZERO blame The real damage is when the youth are allowed to come under the influence of the gangsta shit that modern rappers feed them. Then, the kids turn the words spoken in the songs into actions and turn into respect-less truants Asheru is saying that many wack rappers preach useless things and nonsense in the booth and then \u2018deliver\u2019 the \u2018songs\u2019 to the youth. Such things may be the promotion of gun culture, of drug trafficking, pimping etc. This is a metaphor describing people who spend much more money than they already have or people who spend like they have unlimited money. Asheru\u2019s premonitions (strange feelings about something ) being strong have detected the above mentioned omens and that they don\u2019t belong around Asheru An awning is sheet of metal or other material that jets out of the wall of a shop, tent etc. Asheru is saying that the omens he saw jet out in similar fashion Blacks are often stereotyped in the TV and film industry as overly-aggressive thugs and brash women, both living in impoverished areas with poor education. Asheru wants to show blacks how to be prideful of their race and not to rely on government assistance or anyone else.  Right now, almost 40% of welfare recipients are black. Sampled from One Love As the great Immortal Technique has said and implied numerous times in his album, The Martyr:\n\nYou don\u2019t have to die for revolution: you have to live for it.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=Hj1qQfab_eM#t=4404s Reference to The Notorious B.I.G. classic, \u201cMo Money Mo Problems\u201d. Asheru sees what you up to. Tryin' to write off his words as the braying of a fool when he\u2019s got more realness than you. "}]
